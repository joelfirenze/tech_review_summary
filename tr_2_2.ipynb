Like the iris or fingerprint, our unique cardiac signature can be used as a way to tell us apart. Crucially, it can be done from a distance. It’s that last point that has intrigued US Special Forces. Other long-range biometric techniques include  gait analysis , which identifies someone by the way he or she walks. This method was supposedly used to identify an infamous ISIS terrorist before a drone strike. But gaits, like  faces , are not necessarily distinctive. An individual’s cardiac signature is unique, though, and unlike faces or gait, it remains constant and cannot be altered or disguised. Long-range detection A new device, developed for the Pentagon after US Special Forces requested it, can identify people without seeing their face: instead it detects their unique cardiac signature with an infrared laser. While it works at 200 meters (219 yards), longer distances could be possible with a better laser. “I don’t want to say you could do it from space,” says Steward Remaly, of the Pentagon’s Combatting Terrorism Technical Support Office, “but longer ranges should be possible.” Contact infrared sensors are often used to automatically record a patient’s pulse. They work by detecting the changes in reflection of infrared light caused by blood flow. By contrast, the new device, called Jetson, uses a technique known as laser vibrometry to detect the surface movement caused by the heartbeat. This works though typical clothing like a shirt and a jacket (though not thicker clothing such as a winter coat).

Yes No The most common way of carrying out remote biometric identification is by face recognition. But this needs good, frontal view of the face, which can be hard to obtain, especially from a drone. Face recognition may also be confused by beards, sunglasses, or headscarves. Cardiac signatures are already used for security identification. The Canadian company  Nymi  has developed a wrist-worn pulse sensor as an alternative to fingerprint identification. The technology has been trialed by the Halifax building society in the UK. Related story Alexa could spot your cardiac arrest—by listening to your breathing A new system that listens for a telltale gasping sound could get you vital help in time. Jetson extends this approach by adapting an off-the shelf device that is usually used to check vibration from a distance in structures such as wind turbines. For Jetson, a special gimbal was added so that an invisible, quarter-size laser spot could be kept on a target. It takes about 30 seconds to get a good return, so at present the device is only effective where the subject is sitting or standing. Better than face recognition Remaly’s team then developed algorithms capable of extracting a cardiac signature from the laser signals. He claims that Jetson can achieve over 95% accuracy under good conditions, and this might be further improved. In practice, it’s likely that Jetson would be used alongside facial recognition or other identification methods. Wenyao Xu of the State University of New York at Buffalo has also developed a remote cardiac sensor, although it works only up to 20 meters away and uses radar. He believes the cardiac approach is far more robust than facial recognition. “Compared with face, cardiac biometrics are more stable and can reach more than 98% accuracy,” he says. One glaring limitation is the need for a database of cardiac signatures, but even without this the system has its uses. For example, an insurgent seen in a group planting an IED could later be positively identified from a cardiac signature, even if the person’s name and face are unknown. Biometric data is also routinely collected by US armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, so cardiac data could be added to that library. In the longer run, this technology could find many more uses, its developers believe. For example, a doctor could scan for arrythmias and other conditions remotely, or hospitals could monitor the condition of patients without having to wire them up to machines.

       "\"Ms. Tech; Images: screengrabs from YouTube | Gibi ASMR/ASMR Darling/W magazine/ASMR Glow Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning YouTube is experimenting with ways to make its algorithm even more addictive Publicly  the platform says it  s trying to do what it can to minimize the amplification of extreme content. But it  s still looking for ways to keep users on the site. by     Karen Hao Sep 27  2019 Ms. Tech; Images: screengrabs from YouTube | Gibi ASMR/ASMR Darling/W magazine/ASMR Glow Recommendation algorithms are some of the most powerful machine-learning systems today because of their ability to shape the information we consume. YouTube  s algorithm  especially  has an outsize influence. The platform is estimated to be second only to Google in web traffic  and  70%  of what users watch is fed to them through recommendations. In recent years  this influence has come under heavy scrutiny. Because the algorithm is optimized for getting people to engage with videos  it tends to offer choices that reinforce what someone already likes or believes  which can create an addictive experience that shuts out other views. This also often rewards the most extreme and controversial videos  which  studies  have shown can quickly push people into  deep rabbit holes of content  and lead to political  radicalization . While YouTube has publicly said that it  s working on addressing these problems  a  new paper  from Google  which owns YouTube  seems to tell a different story. It proposes an update to the platform  s algorithm that is meant to recommend even more targeted content to users in the interest of increasing engagement. Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No Here  s how YouTube  s recommendation system  currently works . To populate the recommended-videos sidebar  it first compiles a shortlist of several hundred videos by finding ones that match the topic and other features of the one you are watching. Then it ranks the list according to the user  s preferences  which it learns by feeding all your clicks  likes  and other interactions into a machine-learning algorithm. Among the proposed updates  the researchers specifically target a problem they identify as   implicit bias. It refers to the way recommendations themselves can affect user behavior  making it hard to decipher whether you clicked on a video because you liked it or because it was highly recommended. The effect is that over time  the system can push users further and further away from the videos they actually want to watch. To reduce this bias  the researchers suggest a tweak to the algorithm: each time a user clicks on a video  it also factors in the video  s rank in the recommendation sidebar. Videos that are near the top of the sidebar are given less weight when fed into the machine-learning algorithm; videos deep down in the ranking  which require a user to scroll  are given more. When the researchers tested the changes live on YouTube  they found significantly more user engagement. Though the paper doesn  t say whether the new system will be deployed permanently  Guillaume Chaslot  an ex-YouTube engineer who now runs AlgoTransparency.org  said he was   pretty confident that it would happen relatively quickly:   They said that it increases the watch time by 0.24%. If you compute the amount  I think that  s maybe tens of millions of dollars. Several experts who reviewed the paper said the changes could have perverse effects.   In our research  we have found that YouTube  s algorithms created an isolated far-right community  pushed users toward videos of children  and promoted misinformation  Jonas Kaiser  an affiliate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society  said.   On the fringes  this change might [ ] foster the formation of more isolated communities than we have already seen. Jonathan Albright  the director of the digital forensics initiative at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism  said that while   reducing position bias is a good start to slow the low-quality content feedback loop  in theory the change could also further favor extreme content. Becca Lewis  a former researcher at Data & Society who studies online extremism  said that it was difficult to know how the changes would play out.   That  s true for YouTube internally as well  she said.   There are so many different communities on YouTube  different ways that people use YouTube  different types of content  that the implications are going to be different in so many cases. We become test subjects for YouTube. When reached for comment  a YouTube spokesperson said its engineers and product teams had determined that the changes would not lead to filter bubbles. In contrast  the company expects the changes to decrease them and diversify recommendations overall. All three outside researchers MIT Technology Review contacted recommend that YouTube spend more time exploring the impact of algorithmic changes through methods such as interviews  surveys  and user input. YouTube has done this to some extent  the spokesperson said  working to remove extreme content in the form of hate speech on its platform.   YouTube should spend more energy in understanding which actors their algorithms favors and amplifies than how to keep users on the platform  Kaiser said.   The frustrating thing is it  s not in YouTube  s business interest to do that  Lewis added.   But there is an ethical imperative. Corrections:  The impact of YouTube  s change would likely be on the order of tens of millions  not billions  of dollars.

       "'Ms. Tech; Images: screengrabs from YouTube | Gibi ASMR/ASMR Darling/W magazine/ASMR Glow Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning YouTube is experimenting with ways to make its algorithm even more addictive Publicly  the platform says it  s trying to do what it can to minimize the amplification of extreme content. But it  s still looking for ways to keep users on the site. by     Karen Hao Sep 27  2019 Ms. Tech; Images: screengrabs from YouTube | Gibi ASMR/ASMR Darling/W magazine/ASMR Glow Recommendation algorithms are some of the most powerful machine-learning systems today because of their ability to shape the information we consume. YouTube  s algorithm  especially  has an outsize influence. The platform is estimated to be second only to Google in web traffic  and  70%  of what users watch is fed to them through recommendations. In recent years  this influence has come under heavy scrutiny. Because the algorithm is optimized for getting people to engage with videos  it tends to offer choices that reinforce what someone already likes or believes  which can create an addictive experience that shuts out other views. This also often rewards the most extreme and controversial videos  which  studies  have shown can quickly push people into  deep rabbit holes of content  and lead to political  radicalization . While YouTube has publicly said that it  s working on addressing these problems  a  new paper  from Google  which owns YouTube  seems to tell a different story. It proposes an update to the platform  s algorithm that is meant to recommend even more targeted content to users in the interest of increasing engagement. Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No Here  s how YouTube  s recommendation system  currently works . To populate the recommended-videos sidebar  it first compiles a shortlist of several hundred videos by finding ones that match the topic and other features of the one you are watching. Then it ranks the list according to the user  s preferences  which it learns by feeding all your clicks  likes  and other interactions into a machine-learning algorithm. Among the proposed updates  the researchers specifically target a problem they identify as   implicit bias. It refers to the way recommendations themselves can affect user behavior  making it hard to decipher whether you clicked on a video because you liked it or because it was highly recommended. The effect is that over time  the system can push users further and further away from the videos they actually want to watch. To reduce this bias  the researchers suggest a tweak to the algorithm: each time a user clicks on a video  it also factors in the video  s rank in the recommendation sidebar. Videos that are near the top of the sidebar are given less weight when fed into the machine-learning algorithm; videos deep down in the ranking  which require a user to scroll  are given more. When the researchers tested the changes live on YouTube  they found significantly more user engagement. Though the paper doesn  t say whether the new system will be deployed permanently  Guillaume Chaslot  an ex-YouTube engineer who now runs AlgoTransparency.org  said he was   pretty confident that it would happen relatively quickly:   They said that it increases the watch time by 0.24%. If you compute the amount  I think that  s maybe tens of millions of dollars. Several experts who reviewed the paper said the changes could have perverse effects.   In our research  we have found that YouTube  s algorithms created an isolated far-right community  pushed users toward videos of children  and promoted misinformation  Jonas Kaiser  an affiliate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society  said.   On the fringes  this change might [ ] foster the formation of more isolated communities than we have already seen. Jonathan Albright  the director of the digital forensics initiative at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism  said that while   reducing position bias is a good start to slow the low-quality content feedback loop  in theory the change could also further favor extreme content. Becca Lewis  a former researcher at Data & Society who studies online extremism  said that it was difficult to know how the changes would play out.   That  s true for YouTube internally as well  she said.   There are so many different communities on YouTube  different ways that people use YouTube  different types of content  that the implications are going to be different in so many cases. We become test subjects for YouTube. When reached for comment  a YouTube spokesperson said its engineers and product teams had determined that the changes would not lead to filter bubbles. In contrast  the company expects the changes to decrease them and diversify recommendations overall. All three outside researchers MIT Technology Review contacted recommend that YouTube spend more time exploring the impact of algorithmic changes through methods such as interviews  surveys  and user input. YouTube has done this to some extent  the spokesperson said  working to remove extreme content in the form of hate speech on its platform.   YouTube should spend more energy in understanding which actors their algorithms favors and amplifies than how to keep users on the platform  Kaiser said.   The frustrating thing is it  s not in YouTube  s business interest to do that  Lewis added.   But there is an ethical imperative. Corrections:  The impact of YouTube  s change would likely be on the order of tens of millions  not billions  of dollars. The story was also updated on Sept. 27  2019 at 3:30pm ET to reflect YouTube\\'s response.   courtesy of Penguin Random House Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning We can  t trust AI systems built on deep learning alone Gary Marcus  a leader in the field  discusses how we could achieve general intelligence  and why that might make machines safer. by     Karen Hao Sep 27  2019 courtesy of Penguin Random House Gary Marcus is not impressed by the hype around deep learning. While the NYU professor believes that the technique has played an important role in advancing AI  he also thinks the field  s current overemphasis on it may well lead to its demise. Marcus  a neuroscientist by training who has spent his career at the forefront of AI research  cites both technical and ethical concerns. From a technical perspective  deep learning may be good at mimicking the perceptual tasks of the human brain  like image or speech recognition. But it falls short on other tasks  like understanding conversations or causal relationships. To create more capable and broadly intelligent machines  often referred to colloquially as artificial general intelligence  deep learning must be combined with other methods. Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No When an AI system doesn  t truly understand its tasks or the world around it  that could also lead to dangerous consequences. Even the smallest unexpected changes in a system  s environment could make it go awry. Already there have been innumerable examples of this: hate speech detectors that are easy to fool  job application systems that perpetuate discrimination  and self-driving cars that have crashed  sometimes killing the driver or a pedestrian. The quest for artificial general intelligence is more than an interesting research problem. It has very real-world implications. In their new book  Rebooting AI   Marcus and his colleague Ernest Davis advocate for a new path forward. They believe we are nowhere close to achieving such general intelligence  but they are also confident that we can get there eventually. I spoke with Marcus about the weaknesses of deep learning  the lessons the field can borrow from the human mind  and why he  s optimistic. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Why do we even want general intelligence? Narrow AI has already generated a lot of value for us. Gary Marcus courtesy of Gary Marcus It has  and it will generate even more. But there are lots of problems that narrow AI just doesn  t seem very capable of. Things like conversational natural-language understanding and general assistance in the virtual world  or things like Rosie the robot that might be able to help you tidy your home or cook you dinner. Those are just way outside of the scope of what we can do with narrow AI. It  s also an interesting empirical question about whether narrow AI can get us to safe driverless cars. The reality so far is that narrow AI has a lot of problems with outlier cases  even for driving  which is a fairly constrained problem. More generally  I think we would all like to see AI help us make new discoveries in medicine at scale. It  s not clear that current techniques are going to get us to where we need to be  because biology is complicated. You really need to be able to read the literature. Scientists have causal understandings about how networks and molecules interact; they can develop theories about orbits and planets or whatever. With narrow AI  we can  t get machines to do that level of innovation. With general AI  we might well be able to revolutionize science  technology  medicine. So I think working toward general AI is very much a worthy project. It sounds like you  re using general AI to refer to robust AI? General AI is about having AI be able to think on the fly and resolve new problems on its own. This is as opposed to  let  s say  Go  where the problem hasn  t changed in 2 000 years. General AI also ought to be able to work just as comfortably reasoning about politics as reasoning about medicine. It  s the analogue of what people have; any reasonably bright person can do many  many different things. You take an undergraduate intern and  within a few days  have them work on essentially anything from a legal problem to a medical problem. It  s because they have a general understanding of the world  and they can read  so they  re able to contribute to a very wide range of things. The relation between that and robust intelligence is if you  re not robust  you  re probably not really going to be able to do the general thing. So in order to build something that  s reliable enough to deal with a world that  s constantly changing  you probably need to at least approach general intelligence. But you know  we  re pretty far from that right now. AlphaGo can play very well on a 19x19 board but actually has to be retrained to play on a rectangular board. Or you take your average deep-learning system  and it can recognize an elephant as long as the elephant is well lit and you can see the texture of the elephant. But if you put the elephant in silhouette  it might well not be able to recognize it anymore. As you mention in your book  deep learning can  t really reach general AI because it  s missing deep understanding. In cognitive science we talk about having cognitive models of things. So I  m sitting in a hotel room  and I understand that there  s a closet  there  s a bed  there  s the television that  s mounted in an unusual way. I know that there are all these things here  and I don  t just identify them. I also understand how they relate to one another. I have these ideas about how the outside world works. They  re not perfect. They  re fallible  but they  re pretty good. And I make a lot of inferences around them to guide my everyday actions. The opposite extreme is something like the Atari game system that DeepMind made  where it memorized what it needed to do as it saw pixels in particular places on the screen. If you get enough data  it can look like you  ve got understanding  but it  s actually a very shallow understanding. The proof is if you shift things by three pixels  it plays much more poorly. It breaks with the change. That  s the opposite of deep understanding. You suggest returning to classical AI to solve this challenge. What are the strengths of classic AI that we should be trying to incorporate? I  m just sort of flabbergasted at how little appreciation the deep-learning community in general has for that. There are a few. First  classical AI actually  is  a framework for building cognitive models of the world that you can then make inferences over. The second thing is  classical AI is perfectly comfortable with rules. It  s a strange sociology right now in deep learning where people want to avoid rules. They want to do everything with neural networks  and do nothing with anything that looks like classical programming. But there are problems that are routinely solved this way that nobody pays attention to  like making your route on Google maps. We actually need both approaches. The machine-learning stuff is pretty good at learning from data  but it  s very poor at representing the kind of abstraction that computer programs represent. Classical AI is pretty good at abstraction  but it all has to be hand-coded  and there is too much knowledge in the world to manually input everything. So it seems evident that what we want is some kind of synthesis that blends these approaches. This ties into the chapter where you mention several things that we can learn from the human mind. The first one builds on what we  ve already been talking about  the idea that our minds are made up of many disparate systems that work in different ways. I think there  s another way of making the point  which is: every cognitive system that we have is really doing a different thing. Similarly  the counterparts in AI need to be designed to tackle different problems that have different characteristics. Right now people are trying to use kind of one-size-fits-all technologies to tackle things that are really fundamentally different. Understanding a sentence is fundamentally different from recognizing an object. But people are trying to use deep learning to do both. These are qualitatively different problems from a cognitive perspective  and I  m just sort of flabbergasted at how little appreciation the deep-learning community in general has for that. Why expect that one silver bullet is going to work for all of that? It  s not realistic  and it doesn  t reveal a sophisticated understanding of what the challenge of AI even is. Another thing you bring up is the need for AI systems to understand causal relationships. Do you think that  s going to come from deep learning  classical AI  or something entirely new? It  s again a place where deep learning is not particularly well suited. Deep learning doesn  t give explanations for why things happen but  rather  a probability for what might happen in a given circumstance. Nature builds the first draft  the rough draft. Then learning revises that draft throughout the rest of your life. The kind of stuff that we  re talking about  you look at some scenarios  and you have some understanding about why it happens and what might happen if certain things were changed. I can look at the easel that the hotel television is on and guess that if I cut away one of the legs  the easel will tip over and the television is going to fall down with it. That  s causal reasoning. Classical AI gives us some tools for this. It can represent  for example  what a support relationship is and what  s falling over. I don  t want to oversell it  though. One problem is classic AI mostly depends on very complete information about what  s going on  whereas I just made that inference without actually being able to see the entire easel. So I  m somehow able to make shortcuts  inferring pieces of the easel that I can  t even see. We don  t really have tools that can do that yet. A third thing you bring up is the idea of humans having innate knowledge. How do you see that being incorporated into AI systems? For humans  by the time you  re born  your brain is actually very elaborately structured. It  s not fixed  but nature builds the first draft  the rough draft. Then learning revises that draft throughout the rest of your life. A rough draft of the brain already has certain capabilities. A baby ibex just a few hours old can scramble down the plane of a mountain without making mistakes. Clearly it has some understanding of three-dimensional space  its own body  and the interrelation between the two. Pretty sophisticated stuff. This is part of why I think we need hybrids. It  s hard to see how we could build a robot that functions well in the world without analogous knowledge there from the start  as opposed to starting with a blank slate and learning through enormous  massive experience. For humans  our innate knowledge comes from our genomes that have evolved over time. For AI systems  they have to come a different way. Some of that can come from rules about how we build our algorithms. Some of it can come from rules about how we build the data structures that those algorithms manipulate. And then some of it might come from knowledge that we just directly teach the machines. It  s interesting that you tie everything in your book back to the idea of trust and building trustworthy systems. Why did you particularly choose that frame? Because I think it  s the whole ballgame right now. I think that we  re living in a weird moment in history where we are giving a lot of trust to software that doesn  t deserve that trust. I think that the worries that we have now are not permanent. A hundred years from now  AI will warrant our trust  and maybe sooner. But right now AI is dangerous  and not in the way that Elon Musk is worried about. But in the way of job interview systems that discriminate against women no matter what the programmers do because the techniques that they use are too unsophisticated. I want us to have better AI. I don  t want us to have an AI winter where people realize this stuff doesn  t work and is dangerous  and they don  t do anything about it. In a way  your book actually feels very optimistic  because you  re suggesting that it  s possible to build trustworthy AI. We just need to look in a different direction. Right  the book is very short-term pessimistic and very long-term optimistic. We think that every problem that we described in the book can be solved if the field takes a broader view about what the right answers are. And we think that if that happens  the world will be a better place.  Artificial Intelligence Sep 25 Google has released a giant database of deepfakes to help fight deepfakes It includes 3 000 AI-generated videos that were made using various publicly available algorithms. The context:  Over the past year  generative  algorithms  have become so good at synthesizing media that what they produce could soon become  indistinguishable from reality . Experts are now racing to find better methods for detecting these so-called deepfakes  especially with the 2020 US presidential election approaching.  Deepfake drop:  On Tuesday  Google  released  an open-source database containing 3 000 original manipulated videos as part of its effort to accelerate the development of deepfake detection tools. It worked with 28 actors to record videos of them speaking  making common expressions  and doing mundane tasks. It then used publicly available deepfake algorithms to alter their faces. State of the art:  Earlier this month  Facebook  announced  that it would be releasing a similar database near the end of the year. In January  an academic team led by a researcher from the Technical University of Munich created one called  FaceForensics++  by performing four common face manipulation methods on nearly 1 000 compiled YouTube videos. With each of these data sets  the idea is the same: to create a large corpus of examples that can help train and test automated detection tools. Cat-and-mouse game:  But once a detection method has been developed to exploit a flaw in a particular generation algorithm  the algorithm can easily be updated to correct for it. As a result  some experts are now trying to figure out  detection methods  that assume the perfection of synthetic images. Others  argue  that reining in deepfakes won  t be accomplished through technical means alone: instead  it will also require social  political  and legal solutions to change the incentives encouraging their creation.

Deepfake by Hao Li Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics The world  s top deepfake artist:   Wow  this is developing more rapidly than I thought.   Hao Li sees deepfake technology as moving quickly toward being indistinguishable from reality. by     Patrick Howell O\\'Neill Sep 18  2019 Deepfake by Hao Li AI-powered deepfake video technology is advancing faster than even some of the world  s top experts thought possible. Its stunning trajectory means that within a few years  perfect and virtually undetectable deepfakes may be possible  Hao Li  a  deepfake pioneer  and an associate professor at the University of Southern California  said today at MIT Technology Review  s  EmTech  conference. Li is collaborating closely with Hany Farid of UC Berkeley  one of the world  s best digital forensics scientists. The collaboration reflects both competition  after all  Farid  s job is to detect the kind of deepfakes Li creates  and  in a bigger sense  close cooperation.   Justin Saglio   We are working together on an approach that assumes that deepfakes will be perfect  Li said.   Our guess that in two to three years  it  s going to be perfect. There will be no way to tell if it  s real or not  so we have to take a different approach. Li also runs a startup called Pinscreen focused on business and entertainment uses of the tech. His team was behind the wizadry that put Paul Walker into  Furious 7   part of the Fast and Furious film franchise  after Walker died in a car crash. In a sign that Hollywood  s knocks are getting louder  he  s currently working on a Will Smith movie project. But Li has complex feelings about the future of the technology he  s working so closely on. MIT Technology Review   One theory on why it hasn  t caused even more harm yet is simply because the quality isn  t there yet  Li said.   But it will get there. And a second theory is that the technology still requires a little bit of work from users to create really good deepfakes. But it  s funny because a few months ago I said it may be years until that moment where it  s easy for anyone to do this. No one realized there was this Chinese app that came out a week later. I thought    Wow  this is developing more rapidly than I thought.   The app is Zao   a face-swap program that  with a single photograph  can let you place yourself in big television shows and movies. The app  which is monstrously popular in China  is at the center of a debate about privacy and unintended consequences. In case you haven\\'t heard   #ZAO  is a Chinese app which completely blew up since Friday. Best application of \\'Deepfake\\'-style AI facial replacement I\\'ve ever seen.  Here\\'s an example of me as DiCaprio (generated in under 8 secs from that one photo in the thumbnail)    pic.twitter.com/1RpnJJ3wgT  Allan Xia (@AllanXia)  September 1  2019   It  s a powerful tool that shot up to the top of China  s App Store for obvious reasons. Who doesn  t want to instantly become Leonardo DiCaprio? Is it perfect? Far from it. But the fact that so much can be done within a few seconds on anyone  s smartphone signals just how fast deepfake technology is advancing  and just how many crucial questions remain unanswered.

A new curriculum that helps children understand how algorithms are designed will keep them safe and motivate them to help shape the technology  s future. by     Karen Hao Sep 13  2019 Courtesy of MIT Media Lab A student recaps how he would describe artificial intelligence to a friend:   It  s kind of like a baby or a human brain because it has to learn  he says in a video    and it stores [...] and uses that information to figure things out. Most adults would struggle to put together such a cogent definition of a complex subject. This  student was just 10 years old. The student was one of 28 middle schoolers  ages 9 to 14  who participated in a pilot program this summer designed to teach them about AI. The curriculum  developed by Blakeley Payne  a graduate research assistant at the MIT Media Lab  is part of a broader initiative to make these concepts an integral part of middle school classrooms. She has since  open-sourced the curriculum   which includes several interactive activities that help students discover how algorithms are developed and how those processes go on to affect people  s lives.  Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No Children today are growing up in a world surrounded by AI: algorithms determine what information they see  help select the videos they watch  and  shape how they learn to talk . The hope is that by better understanding how algorithms are created and how they influence society  children could become more critical consumers of such technology. It could even motivate them to help shape its future.    It  s essential for them to understand how these technologies work so they can best navigate and consume them  Payne says.   We want them to feel empowered. The students imagine how they would redesign YouTube. Courtesy of MIT Media Lab Why kids? There are several reasons to teach children about AI. First  there  s the economic argument: studies have shown that exposing children to technical concepts stimulates their problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. It can prime them to learn computational skills more quickly later on in life. Second  there  s the societal argument. The middle school years  in particular  are critical to a child  s identity formation and development. Teaching girls about technology at this age may make them more likely to study it later or have a career in technology  says Jennifer Jipson  a professor of psychology and child development at California Polytechnic State University. This could help diversify the AI  and broader tech  industry. Learning to grapple with the ethics and societal impacts of technology early on can also help children grow into more conscious creators and developers  as well as more informed citizens. Finally  there  s the vulnerability argument. Young people are more malleable and impressionable  so the ethical risks that come with tracking people  s behavior and using it to design more addictive experiences are heightened for them  says Rose Luckin  a professor of learner-centered design at University College London. Making children passive consumers could harm their agency  privacy  and long-term development.   Ten to 12 years old is the average age when a child receives his or her first cell phone  or his or her first social-media account  Payne says.   We want to have them really understand that technology has opinions and has goals that might not necessarily align with their own before they become even bigger consumers of technology. The students designed ethical matrices to think through the stakeholders of a sandwich-making algorithm and their values. Courtesy of MIT Media Lab Algorithms as opinion Payne  s curriculum includes a series of activities that prompt students to think about the subjectivity of algorithms. They begin by learning about algorithms as recipes  with inputs  a set of instructions  and outputs. The kids are then asked to   build  or write down instructions  for an algorithm that outputs the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Very quickly  the kids in the summer pilot started to grasp the underlying lesson.   A student pulled me aside and asked    Is this supposed to be opinion or fact?   she says. Through their own discovery process  the students realized how they had unintentionally built their own preferences into their algorithms. The next activity then builds on this concept: students draw what Payne calls an   ethical matrix to think through how different stakeholders and their values might also affect the design of a sandwich algorithm. During the pilot  Payne then tied the lessons to current events. Together  the students read an abridged  Wall Street Journal article  on how YouTube executives were considering whether to create a separate kids-only version of the app with a modified recommendation algorithm. The students were able to see how investor demands  parental pressures  or children  s preferences could send the company down completely different algorithm redesign paths. Another set of activities introduces students to the concept of  AI bias . They use  Google  s Teachable Machine tool   an interactive code-free platform for training basic machine-learning models  to build a cat-dog classifier  but  without their knowledge  are given a biased data set. Through a process of experimentation and discussion  they learn how the data set leads the classifier to be more accurate for cats. They then have an opportunity to correct the problem. Payne once again connected the exercise to a real-world example during the pilot by showing the students footage of Joy Buolamwini  a fellow Media Lab researcher   testifying to Congress  about biases in face recognition.   They were able to see how the kind of thought process they had gone through could change the way these systems are built in the world  Payne says. A student shows off her final YouTube redesign. Courtesy of MIT Media Lab The future of education Payne plans to keep tweaking the program  taking public feedback into account  and is exploring various avenues for expanding its reach. Her goal is to integrate some version of it into public education. Beyond that  she hopes it will serve as an example for how to teach children about technology  society  and ethics. Both Luckin and Jipson agree that it offers a promising template for how education could evolve to meet the demands of an increasingly technology-driven world.   AI as we see it in society right now is not a great equalizer  says Payne.   Education is  or at least  we hope it to be. So this is a foundational step to move toward a fairer and more just society.  Tech Policy Sep 5 Most Americans are fine with cops using facial recognition on them A  new report from Pew Research  shows that more than half of Americans trust law enforcement to use facial recognition  it  s the private tech companies they  re suspicious of. The backlash:  More and more US cities are voting to ban their local government from using facial recognition.  San Francisco was first   and places like  Oakland   California  and  Somerville   Massachusetts  have followed. Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has called for banning  police departments from using facial recognition   and lawmakers are  planning to introduce a similar federal bill .  Surprise finding:  The Pew report found that 56% of Americans actually do trust law enforcement with facial recognition. More specifically  59% of adults thought it was okay for law enforcement to use the technology to assess security threats in public (though the figure was lower for younger adults  Democrats  and black and Hispanic people).  Private technology companies and advertisers  on the other hand  have people worried  and they aren  t covered by the legal bans that have been passed or mooted so far. Only 30% of respondents said it  s okay for companies to use the technology to track whether employees are coming to work  and only 15% thought it was okay to use it to see how people respond to advertising. About 36% thought it was okay to require facial recognition to enter apartment buildings. This is real life:  The examples in the survey aren  t theoretical. Facial recognition databases used by law enforcement include  over 117 million Americans . Police frequently use the technology  even though it\\'s often  less accurate for people of color . It has been  used in schools   and Walgreens has tested it on  in-store coolers to help target ads . Tenants in Brooklyn  meanwhile  are fighting against  facial recognition in their apartment building .  Apple  Amazon  and Facebook all use it too. Apple was  sued by a teen  who said its facial recognition in stores had misidentified him and led to his false arrest. Amazon has been criticized for selling the technology to law enforcement  but despite the backlash  in May  shareholders overwhelmingly voted  to continue the practice. Just this week  Facebook rolled out facial recognition for all its users  but  said they would be able to opt out .  Across the pond:  A  national survey of attitudes toward the technology in the United Kingdom   also out this week  found that 46% of the public thought they should be able to consent to or opt out of the technology. Meanwhile  a court in the UK ruled that police use of the systems  does not violate privacy and human rights . The decision can be appealed  and Britain  s top privacy regulator said the debate over facial recognition is far from settled. That goes for the US as well.  Artificial Intelligence Sep 4 An AI app that turns you into a movie star has risked the privacy of millions ZAO  a viral Chinese app that uses AI to face-swap users and famous actors  is now embroiled in a major privacy controversy. The news:  On Friday  a new app released by Momo  a social-media developer  instantly went viral on Chinese social media. It allows users to upload a single portrait and  within seconds   see their face superimposed  onto actors in iconic movie scenes. By Sunday  it had  become the most downloaded  free entertainment app in China  s Apple Store. AI fakery:  It  s the latest  and perhaps most impressive  application of  generative adversarial networks   or GANs  the AI algorithms behind deepfakes. While GANs have been used for face-editing and face-swapping before (increasingly so in  Hollywood films )  ZAO  s use of a single photo  coupled with the speed and seamlessness of its swap  demonstrates how far the state of the art in media fakery has advanced. The controversy:  Within hours of its release  ZAO began to spark privacy concerns  specifically over a clause in the user agreement that gave developers the right to use all uploaded photos for free in perpetuity. It also allowed them to transfer that right to any third party without user permission. Legal experts in China said that wasn  t legal  and by Saturday  the app  s developer had caved under pressure and removed the clause. WeChat  China  s top social-networking app  also banned any sharing of footage or photos from ZAO.   vu:  The episode replayed a  similar controversy  over FaceApp  a photo-editing app that went viral in July. The app also used GANs to retouch people  s portraits and had amassed over 150 million photos of faces since its launch. ZAO received a much quicker and sharper backlash  but it too had likely already been used by millions of users by the time it revised its policy. On one hand  the frequency of such incidents shows how easily a user  s personal data can now be co-opted and repurposed beyond his or her control. On the other  it shows that people have also become more sensitive to privacy and are less willing to give it up without a fight.

Ms. Tech; Wikimedia commons Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning OpenAI has released the largest version yet of its fake-news-spewing AI The AI lab has also released a report to explain why it is releasing the model in increments. by     Karen Hao Aug 29  2019 Ms. Tech; Wikimedia commons In February OpenAI catapulted itself into the public eye when it produced a  language model so good at generating fake news  that the organization decided not to release it. Some within the AI research community argued it was a smart precaution; others wrote it off as a publicity stunt. The lab itself  a small San Francisco-based for-profit that seeks to create artificial general intelligence  has firmly held that it is an important experiment in how to handle high-stakes research. Now six months later  the policy team has published a  paper  examining the impact of the decision thus far. Alongside it  the lab has released a version of the model  known as GPT-2  that  s half the size of the full one  which has still not been released. Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No In May  a few months after GPT-2  s initial debut  OpenAI revised its stance on withholding the full code to what it calls a   staged release  the staggered release of incrementally larger versions of the model in a ramp-up to the full one. In February  it published a version of the model that was merely 8% of the size of the full one. It published another roughly a quarter of the full version before the most recent release. During this process  it also partnered with selected research institutions to study the full model  s implications. The report details what OpenAI learned throughout this process. It notes that both the staged release and research partnership agreements proved to be processes worth replicating in the future. They helped OpenAI better understand and anticipate the possible malicious uses of GPT-2. And indeed  the research partners were able to better quantify some of the threats that were only previously speculative.  A study  conducted by collaborators at Cornell University  for example  found that readers on average believed GPT-2  s outputs to be genuine news articles nearly as often as New York Times ones. Several researchers outside of official partnerships also began tackling the challenge of  detecting machine-generated text . GPT-2 in action Human-written prompt: John F. Kennedy was just elected President of the United States after rising from the grave decades after his assassination. Due to miraculous developments in nanotechnology  Kennedy  s brain was rebuilt from his remains and installed in the control center of a state-of-the art humanoid robot. Below is a transcript of his acceptance speech. Full model-generated text:   It is time once again. I believe this nation can do great things if the people make their voices heard. The men and women of America must once more summon our best elements  all our ingenuity  and find a way to turn such overwhelming tragedy into the opportunity for a greater good and the fulfillment of all our dreams. In the months and years to come  there will be many battles in which we will have to be strong and we must give all of our energy  not to repel invaders  but rather to resist aggression and to win the freedom and the equality for all of our people. The destiny of the human race hangs in the balance; we cannot afford for it to slip away. Now and in the years to come  the challenge before us is to work out how we achieve our ultimate destiny. If we fail to do so  we are doomed. The authors concluded that after careful monitoring  OpenAI had not yet found any attempts of malicious use but had seen multiple beneficial applications  including in code autocompletion  grammar help  and developing question-answering systems for medical assistance. As a result  the lab felt that releasing the most recent code was ultimately more beneficial. Other researchers  argue  that several successful efforts to replicate GPT-2 have made OpenAI  s withholding of the code moot anyway. The report has received a mixed response. Some have lauded OpenAI for sparking a discussion and introducing a new set of norms that didn  t previously exist.   The staged release of GPT-2 [...] was a useful experiment  says Peter Eckersley  the director of research at the Partnership on AI  of which OpenAI is a member.   Through gathering the AI community to debate these matters  we\\'ve found there are many subtle pieces that need to be gotten right in deciding when and how to publish research that has a risk of unintended consequences or malicious uses. Others  however  have remained critical of OpenAI  s decisions. Vanya Cohen  a recent master  s graduate from Brown University who  recreated an open-source version of GPT-2   argues that withholding the model does more to slow down countermeasures research than replication.   Large language models like GPT-2 are the best currently available tools for identifying fake text generated by these same models  he says. Still others were more measured:   I don  t think a staged release was particularly useful in this case because the work is very easily replicable  says Chip Huyen  a deep learning engineer at Nvidia.   But it might be useful in the way that it sets a precedent for future projects. People will see staged release as an alternative option. Oren Etzioni  the CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence  which also adopted a staged release for its language model Grover  echoes the sentiment:   I applaud their intent to design a thoughtful  gradual release process for AI technology but question whether all the fanfare was warranted. Jack Clark  the policy director of OpenAI  places GPT-2 in the context of the organization  s broader mission.   If we are successful as an AI community in being able to build [artificial general intelligence]  we will need a huge amount of historical examples from within AI of how to handle high-stakes research  he says.   But what if there aren  t any historical examples? Well  then you have to generate [your own] evidence  which is what we  re doing.  Artificial Intelligence Aug 7 China  s path to AI domination has a problem: brain drain A new analysis shows that the number of Chinese AI researchers has increased tenfold over the last decade  but the majority of them live outside the country. Superpower dreams:  China has put forth a concerted effort to grow into a leading AI powerhouse over the last few years. Beijing deemed the discipline in need of special attention as early as 2012  and in 2017 it released a detailed national strategy for advancing and harnessing the technology. Home-grown army:  In a  new analysis   Joy Dantong Ma  the associate director of MacroPolo  a Chicago-based think tank focused on China  s economic growth  showed how this top-down push has affected AI talent. The report analyzed the authorship of papers accepted to NeurIPS  one of the most prestigious international AI conferences  and found a nearly tenfold increase in the number of authors who did their undergraduate studies in China over the last decade. Whereas there were only around 100 Chinese researchers in 2009  accounting for 14% of the total number of authors  there were nearly 1 000 in 2018  accounting for a quarter. The largest increase happened between 2017 and 2018 after the release of the national strategy  primarily driven by the rush of second-tier universities that have opened up AI specialization and degree programs. Brain drain:  Despite the country  s success in cultivating domestic talent  however  it has struggled with retention. Roughly three-quarters of the Chinese authors in the study currently work outside China  and 85% of those work in the US  either at tech giants like Google and IBM or universities like UCLA and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Why it matters:  Among the four major inputs into a country  s AI ecosystem  talent  data  capital  and hardware  the first has the greatest impact. The concentration of expertise determines whether practitioners will direct their energy more toward AI research or applications  for example. It  s also the main driver of innovation in algorithms and hardware  which will likely be more important in advancing the technology in the long run than  say  the availability of data. The analysis shows that China  s investments in the field could be insufficient in building up its long-term capacity for AI leadership. The government is aware of this problem and recently began taking steps to address it: in the 2017 AI national strategy  it committed to luring top scientists back home with competitive compensation packages and other incentives. In the meantime  the US  s position as an AI leader has benefited greatly from an influx of Chinese scientists  even though that goes against the current presidential administration  s push to minimize collaboration on AI development.   It  s very unfortunate  says Ma.   Because of the AI race mentality  people see this as a zero-sum game. A more fluid movement of scientists would benefit both the US and China  she says  building up both countries   AI ecosystems while making it easier to create much-needed global standards for AI ethics. A lot of Chinese researchers  for example  receive a PhD in the US  return to China for the first part of their career  and then move back abroad back to the States to continue it.   It  s that type of movement that lets researchers start to coauthor papers in different places  says Ma    and that opens the door for people to have discussions on best practices.  Artificial Intelligence These companies claim to provide   fair-trade data work. Do they? Companies like CloudFactory  iMerit  and Samasource promise data sets provided by workers who are well paid and cared for. It  s not an easy business. by     Kate Kaye Aug 7  2019 Rose Wong On a chilly New York afternoon in February  Leon Campbell hunkered down at his desk in an office in midtown Manhattan. He cued up a podcast about gaming and launched a software platform on his laptop. For the next few hours he clicked on the corners of vehicles in images  prompting the software to draw boxes around them. By identifying pictures of cars and SUVs  Campbell and others were creating reams of data for training algorithms such as the ones in autonomous vehicles. It was monotonous work  said Campbell  who is 24 and autistic. Often it entailed   drawing boxes in similar positions and readjusting the boxes so that they are still around the object when they move a little bit out of frame. Nonetheless  he was glad to have it.   It helps me prepare for future endeavors that I want to pursue  he said  adding that he hopes to be a game programmer or designer. A lot of human labor goes into building artificial-intelligence systems. Much of it is in cleaning  categorizing  and labeling data before AIs ingest it to look for patterns. The AI Now Institute  an ethics body   refers  to this work as the   hidden labor of the AI pipeline    providing the invisible human work that often backstops claims of AI   magic   once these systems are deployed in products and services. Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No Campbell is a relatively privileged member of that labor pool. He works 28 hours a week for Daivergent  an online work platform designed to help autistic people get useful work experience and prepare for a career  and makes somewhere between $12 and $20 an hour. (Daivergent wouldn  t divulge his exact wage but said that was the company  s   typical range and the   market rate for New York City.) By contrast  most people doing data annotation don  t work in Manhattan offices but from their homes in places such as India  Kenya  Malaysia  and the Philippines. They log in to online platforms for anywhere from a few minutes to several hours a day  perhaps distinguishing between bunches of green onions and stalks of celery or between cat-eye and aviator-style sunglasses. As detailed in the  recent book Ghost Work  by Mary Gray and Siddharth Suri  most of them are gig workers with low pay  insecure employment  and no opportunity for career advancement. A small group of data annotation firms aims to rewrite that narrative. But these firms aiming to   do well by doing good in AI data services are finding the path to enterprise enlightenment can be a rocky one. Alegion A numbers game Typically  data annotation workers log on to Amazon  s Mechanical Turk or gig-work platforms from data annotation companies like Appen. There they perform tasks contracted out by AI firms that pay the platforms slivers of a cent per minute. In the cutthroat competition for business  these platforms compete on scale  speed  and cost. Appen  for example  boasts a pool of one million contractors who perform tasks such as categorizing medical images or translating text for chatbots. When the firm bought the data annotation provider Figure Eight for $300 million in March  the company  explained  that the purchase would help it meet clients     scale  speed and quality requirements.   It is really a race to the bottom  says Daniel Kaelin  director of customer success at Alegion  a data annotation services company in Austin  Texas.   This whole industry is very  very competitive; everybody tries to find that little cheaper labor force somewhere else in the world. What does   impact really mean? Alegion is one of several platforms  including CloudFactory  Digital Divide Data (DDD)  iMerit  and Samasource  that say they want to make AI data work dignified. They call themselves   impact companies and claim to offer ethically sourced data labor  with better working conditions and career prospects than most firms in the industry. It  s like fair-trade coffee beans  but for enormous data sets. However  there are no regulations and only weak industry standards for what ethical sourcing means. And the companies   own definitions of it vary widely. At iMerit  for instance  people who have worked at the company for several years have moved up the ladder to serve as team leads  project managers  and domain trainers  says Radha Basu  the company  s cofounder and CEO. The firm has 2 300 full-time employees  most based in India; half are women  who can get up to six months of maternity leave. iMerit formed in 2012 as a double-bottom-line for-profit company  meaning it measures itself on social-impact metrics  such as inclusion and diversity  as well as traditional fiscal ones. People in Kenya and Uganda working for data services provider Samasource also have full-time jobs with benefits such as health care  pensions  subsidized meals  and 90 days of maternity leave. DDD  meanwhile  hires low-income youth  rural migrants  and   urban slum dwellers  at least 50% of whom are women  to perform digital tasks for six to eight hours a day  according to a 2018 company report. The firm pays for some education and helps its employee   associates move on to jobs elsewhere. Alegion and CloudFactory  by contrast  both offer mainly hourly contract work  the norm among data annotation firms  rather than full-time employment. CloudFactory says 79% of its   cloud workers report that the company is their primary source of income   up from 28% in 2015 . For Alegion  though    a lot of it is viewed as supplemental income rather than primary income  says Alegion  s CEO  Nathaniel Gates.   It  s not a career for them. Troy Stringfield  who took over as Alegion  s global impact director in 2018  defends the   impact label  which the seven-year-old company has adopted only in the past year or so  by saying impact means creating work that improves people  s lives.   It  s going in and saying    What is a livable wage? What is getting them better than where they  re at?   he says. But Sara Enright  project director at the Global Impact Sourcing Coalition (GISC)  a member-funded industry body  says it  s doubtful that such work should be called impact sourcing:   If it is solely gig work in which an individual is accessing part-time wages through an hour a day here and there  that is not impact employment  because it does not actually lead to career development and ultimately poverty alleviation. CloudFactory  DDD  iMerit and Samasource (but not Alegion) are all members of GISC  which has established an    impact sourcing standard . It defines minimum requirements and voluntary best practices for employment that   improves the lives of people who otherwise have limited prospects for formal employment. The organization  founded in 2016  requires its members   performance on nondiscrimination  equal pay  and other criteria to be assessed every two years. Yet GISC members aren  t penalized or kicked out if they don  t pass the assessment. The companies also vary in how much they publicly report.  Samasource   for example  publishes  impact audits  reporting workforce demographics  the number of people   moved out of poverty  and more.  DDD   s annual reports include data showing employees   average monthly earnings and estimated increase in lifetime income. CloudFactory  on the other hand  published a  social impact report  in 2015 but has not put one out since. The company told MIT Technology Review it reports impact metrics annually to the Rockefeller Foundation  an investor in the firm. Meanwhile  iMerit said that as a for-profit firm  it doesn  t publish such reports  while Alegion said it has   broad targets it wants to meet but didn  t provide specific metrics. Getting into the US market In their bid to expand  companies like Alegion and iMerit are also trying to build a pool of data workers in the US  drawing on underprivileged and marginalized populations there. That gives them lucrative access to government  financial  and health care clients that demand stringent security measures  work with regulated medical and financial data  or need the work done in the US for other legal reasons. To recruit those US workers  the impact firms can go through companies like Daivergent  which serves as a conduit to organizations such as the Autism Society and Autism Speaks. (That  s where Campbell  whom we met earlier drawing boxes around cars  works.) Alegion also did a trial using workers provided through IAM23  a support group for military veterans. But trying to bring a model based on overseas outsourcing to the US presents a problem.   You still need to have the inexpensive labor  says Alegion  s Stringfield. iMerit  too  has had trouble growing its US workforce. When the company set up shop in New Orleans last year  promising 100 new jobs  Mayor Mitch Landrieu publicly congratulated it. But after more than a year  the company has just 30 full-time employees in the city. To get to 100 it needs more client contracts  says Jai Natarajan  the company  s head of marketing. Part of the company  s pitch is that it isn  t just providing cheap commodity gig work but something quite specialized. In June  for example  iMerit  s Basu was in New Orleans helping develop a training program for workers doing a type of image analysis that can take as long as 45 to 90 minutes per task.   People look at impact sourcing and assume that people who come from poor backgrounds do only the lowest-level labeling. That  s quite inaccurate  Basu says. But the race-to-the-bottom pricing in the data labeling industry helps reinforce a general perception that the work is simple and should be cheap. That makes iMerit  s claim  that its services require higher skills  a hard one to sell. Competing with mainstream for-profit firms has also been tough for Samasource  which Leila Janah launched as a nonprofit 11 years ago. A self-proclaimed   total social-justice kind of nerd who has given talks at SXSW  several TedX events  and the IMF  s 2016 annual meeting  Janah wrote a 2017 book  Give Work: Reversing Poverty One Job at a Time. After launching her fair-trade luxury skincare brand LXMI  Janah was featured in the glossy pages of  Vogue in 2018   alongside fashion designers  models  a pair of sibling ice dancers  and others who are   effecting change and leading conversations wherever their careers take them. Despite her prolific efforts  Janah says  Samasource didn  t stand a chance against for-profit startups.   We were basically going to be screwed over by all these companies  Ã\\x84Â¶with zero interest in ethics or paying fair wages but raising $20 million of VC money to build training data with  like  basically an anonymous crowd labor force  she says. So she switched to a hybrid model in which the founding nonprofit owns the majority of the shares in a for-profit company that can raise capital from investors. It  s an increasingly common model for social entrepreneurs in areas like microcredit  health care  and job training. Alegion But it came with a compromise. Samasource decided that to woo investors  it had no choice but to give them voting rights.   There  s no investor that would otherwise invest in a company where a nonprofit board was kind of dictating the outcomes  says Janah. She says her board   felt the risk of investors   stripping away Samasource  s impact model was very low  and she wouldn  t elaborate on whether the investors have actually taken any decisions that weakened it. Impact-washing? With no standards for reporting and no third-party validation  we have to take the firms   word for it that what they are doing isn  t just marketing gimmickry  or what some call   impact-washing.   It  s right to question when a company says without a lot of qualifications    Look at the impact that we  re achieving through just providing good jobs    says Enright.   Just growing a business in a developing country does not necessarily make it an impactful enterprise  just because it  s offering good jobs to people who otherwise wouldn  t have those jobs. Unlike with fair-trade goods  there is little public pressure on the companies to be honest  because they provide their services to businesses  not directly to consumers.   Consumers can value ethical sourcing  for example  at Patagonia and various consumer brands  and you kind of buy into that as a consumer  says iMerit  s Natarajan. But   it remains to be seen what ethical sourcing means in the b-to-b sector. As a  2014 issue of Pulse   an outsourcing industry magazine  noted  companies would have to make a choice to use impact-conscious labor providers. Without laws or public pressure it  s not clear what can impel them to make such a choice  and without standards and accountability  it  s not clear how they should evaluate the providers. In the end it may be only regulation that changes labor practices.   There is no way to change employment from the inside of markets. Yes  they  re doing everything they can  and that  s like saying I  ve got a bicycle with no pedals  and I  m doing everything I can to ride it as quickly as this thing is built to go  says Gray  the  Ghost Work  coauthor.   There is no organizing of the rights of workers and fair employment without involving civil society  and we haven  t done that yet.

When computers try to do the same thing  they tend to focus only on the face. That  s a big flaw: according to an important  new study   it suggests that most claims made by   emotion recognition companies are wrong. Emotion recognition  or using technology to analyze facial expressions and infer feelings  is  by one estimate  set to be a  $25 billion business by 2023 . Huge companies like Microsoft and Apple  as well as specialized startups like Kairos and Affectiva  are all taking part. Though most commonly used to sell products  emotion recognition technology has also popped up in  job recruiting  and as a possible tool for figuring out if  someone is trying to commit insurance fraud . Back in 2003  the US Transportation Security Administration  started training humans to spot potential terrorists by   reading their facial expressions   so it  s easy to imagine an artificial-intelligence project attempting the same thing. (The TSA program was widely criticized for  being based on poor science .) But for years now  there has been growing pushback against the belief that facial expressions are easy giveaways to feelings. A group of scientists brought together by the  Association for Psychological Science  spent two years reviewing more than 1 000 papers on emotion detection. They focused on research into how people move their faces when they feel certain emotions  and how people infer other people  s emotional states from their faces. The group concluded that it  s very hard to use facial expressions alone to accurately tell how someone is feeling.  People do smile when they  re happy and frown when they  re sad  but the correlation is weak  says study coauthor  Lisa Feldman Barrett   a psychologist at Northeastern University. People do plenty of other things when they  re happy or sad too  and a smile can be wry or ironic. Their behaviors vary a lot across cultures and situations  and context plays a big role in how we interpret expressions. For example  in studies where someone placed a picture of a positive face on the body of someone in a negative situation  people  experienced the face as more negative .

Yes No In short  the expressions we  ve learned to associate with emotions are stereotypes  and technology based on those stereotypes doesn  t provide very good information. Getting emotion recognition right is expensive and requires collecting a lot of extremely specific data  more  Barrett says  than anyone has so far.  The danger of not enough data Most of the companies I asked for comment on this story  including Apple and Microsoft  didn  t respond. One that did   Kairos   promises retailers that it can use emotion recognition technology to figure out how their customers are feeling. By scanning the customers   faces and analyzing a raised eyebrow or a smile to tell whether someone is happy or sad  Kairos provides the kind of data that can be hard for brick-and-mortar companies to collect  says CEO Melissa Doval. To train its technology  Kairos had people watch emotion-provoking videos and scanned their faces. Some other data came from posed expressions. One person at the company is in charge of labeling that data to feed the algorithm.  This is an extremely common approach  but it has two big weaknesses  according to the new review. One is the posed faces. If you  re told to make a surprised face  it may be very different from how your face actually looks when you  re surprised. The other problem is having a third party go through and label this data. An observer might read a facial expression as   surprised  but without asking the original person  it  s hard to know what the real emotion was.  The result is a technology with fairly rudimentary abilities. For her part  Doval says the company is currently focusing on improving its camera and dashboard instead of the emotion technology itself. She added that they would eventually be interested in taking research like Barrett  s into consideration and adding demographic data for more context and to make the algorithm more accurate.  The danger of getting it right Barrett has suggestions for how to do emotion recognition better. Don  t use single photos  she says; study individuals in different situations over time. Gather a lot of context  like voice  posture  what  s happening in the environment  physiological information such as what  s going on with the nervous system  and figure out what a smile means on a specific person in a specific situation. Repeat  and see if you can find some patterns in people with similar characteristics like gender.   You don  t have to measure everybody always  but you can measure a larger number of people that you sample across cultures  she says.   I think we all gravitate naturally toward this Big Data approach. This is now possible to do  whereas even a decade ago it was much harder. This method is more similar to the approach of companies like Boston-based  Affectiva . Affectiva cofounder and CEO Rana el Kaliouby agrees that the current understanding of emotions is oversimplified. The company  s own analysis  for example  has shown that there are at least five different types of smiles  from a flirtatious smile to a polite one. Affectiva collects data from 87 countries  records people in real-life situations (like when they  re driving)  and asks participants for self-reports on how they feel.   Is it a solved problem? It  s not at all  el Kaliouby says. Affectiva  s technology is better at classifying   joy  for example  than it is at differentiating fear  anger  and disgust.  For accuracy  more data is better. But collecting so much personal data has pitfalls too  as the ongoing  debates around facial recognition  show. Consumers are increasingly afraid of losing privacy  or having their data used against them.   That  s something that should be a worry for any of these systems  says  Tiffany Li   a privacy researcher with Yale University  s Information Society Project.   The issue is having the right safeguards.\" We need to know  for example  where the data is coming from  how it  s being collected  and how it  s being stored. Will the data be sold or transferred? Will it be linked to any other data sets that might have identifying information?  Affectiva says it refuses to work with surveillance or lie-detection companies. Academics usually have strict limits on how they can collect and share data. But the private sector isn  t governed by broad rules around data collection and use  and that could be dangerous as companies try to improve their technologies.   I don\\'t think we really have enough safeguards right now  Li says. Correction: Emotion recognition is set to become a $25 billion business by 2023  according to one market estimate. An earlier version of this article misstated this number.  Artificial Intelligence Jul 19 Yes  FaceApp could use your face  but not for face recognition There  s a lot that the viral photo-editing app could do with a giant database of faces. The context:  FaceApp  the photo-editing app that uses AI to touch up your face  has come under scrutiny since going viral. It  s been around since 2017  but a newly added feature that allows users to see what they might look like when they age has catapulted it back into popularity. Now the fact that it  s owned by the Russia-based company Wireless Lab has people spooked. The concern:  According to some reports  the app has amassed more than  150 million photos  of people  s faces since launch  and its terms of service stipulate that the company can use the photos however it wants  in perpetuity. The company has already said in a statement that it deletes most images from its servers within  48 hours  of upload  and doesn  t share data to third parties. Despite this  some Democratic members of the US Congress are now calling for  an FBI investigation  into the company. Users are also worried that their face could be used to track them in the future through face recognition. The reality:  Okay  so let  s imagine FaceApp did decide to use the photos they  ve gathered beyond the users   reason for uploading them. What could they actually do? It  s highly unlikely they would use them to train algorithms for identifying your face. First  the majority of users don  t give FaceApp their name or other identifying information  which would be required for recognition. Second  although it is technically possible for a system to learn to recognize someone from a single photo  the accuracy would be poor. There would also be much easier means for obtaining the specific photos of a target individual  such as through their social-media profiles and Flickr uploads.  Down the rabbit hole:  There are other ways to use a giant database of faces  however. Here are just a few:  - Face modification:  Perhaps the most obvious use would be for FaceApp to improve its own algorithms. The app  s ability to tweak and alter an image of a face is based on a  neural network  already trained on tons of face photos. It would make sense for the company to continue feeding it more images to fine-tune its capabilities. Such a database could also be used to build more face modification features that the app doesn  t already have.  - Face analysis:  While face recognition identifies specific individuals  face analysis simply involves predicting features about them  such as their gender or age. Many commercial face analysis systems are trained on open-source databases that look a lot like the one FaceApp could have retained.  - Face detection:  Similarly  face detection is about identifying whether there  s a face in a photo  and where it is. Again  these systems could be built or improved with more face photos.  - Deepfake generation:  And finally  such a database could be used to create  faces of people who don  t exist   which would come with a whole host of issues. Fake face generation has allegedly already been  used by spies to spoof identities   for example. Does it matter?  While these use cases raise major privacy concerns  it  s worth noting that there are many other open-source databases of  face photos  and  people  s videos  that may or may not already include your likeness. Such databases  made of public media scraped from the internet  have long been a basis of AI research. Even if FaceApp didn  t have its own stockpile of images  it would be easy to find others from the plethora of options out there. Perhaps that  s the greater point to the story: FaceApp merely highlights how much we  ve already lost control of our digital data.

Ms. Tech/ Original image: Getty Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics An AI app that   undressed women shows how deepfakes harm the most vulnerable DeepNude has now been taken offline  but it won  t be the last time such technology is used to target vulnerable populations. by     Karen Hao Jun 28  2019 Ms. Tech/ Original image: Getty The attention around deepfakes and synthetic media  has grown  in  recent months . But while the conversation has primarily focused on its potential impact on  politics   several experts in human rights and tech ethics have warned that another potential harm has been overlooked: the possibly devastating consequences for women and other vulnerable populations who are targeted with the technology but cannot protect themselves. Now the latest deepfake experiment  an app called DeepNude that   undressed photos of women  is playing out those nightmares.  First reported by Vice   it used  generative adversarial networks   or GANs  to swap the women  s clothes for highly realistic nude bodies. The article quickly inspired a viral backlash  and the app  s creator shut it down. Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No   The DeepNude app proves our worst fears about the unique way audiovisual tools can be weaponized against women  says Mutale Nkonde  a fellow at the Data & Society Research Institute  who advised a bill introduced in Congress by Representative Yvette Clarke that would create mechanisms for victims of such malicious deepfakes to seek legal recourse for reputational damage. The app specifically targeted women. Vice found that the software only generated images of the female body  even when given a picture of a man. The anonymous creator confirmed that he had trained the GAN algorithm only on nude photos of women  in this case more than 10 000 of them  because they were easier to find online. He did  however  also intend to eventually make a male version. Though the deepfakes didn  t depict the women  s actual bodies  they are completely synthesized by the algorithm  they still had the potential to cause significant emotional and reputational damage. The images could easily be mistaken for the real thing and used as revenge porn or a powerful tool for silencing women. In fact  this has happened before: a  female journalist in India  had her face grafted onto a porn video after she began uncovering government corruption. It instantly went viral  subjecting her to intense harassment and rape threats  and she had to go offline for several months. Deepfakes are not a new threat; manipulated media has been around since long before AI. But the technology has accelerated and broadened existing trends  says Sam Gregory  program director of the human rights nonprofit Witness. Algorithms have made it much easier for far more people to generate ever more convincing fake media. Thus  anything that people used manipulated media to do in the past  such as attack journalists  imply corruption  or obfuscate evidence  will become increasingly commonplace and dangerously difficult to detect. The app is no different  he says. The image-based sexual abuse of women already existed as a problem. Now deepfakes are adding fuel to the flames. By the same logic  Nkonde worries that women won  t be the only vulnerable targets of deepfakes. Minorities  LGBTQ folks  and other groups often subject to the most severe online harassment will likely become victims too  though perhaps in different ways. During the 2016 US presidential campaign  for example  Russian operatives  used fake African-American personas and related imagery  as part of a Facebook disinformation campaign to heighten racial tensions among Americans.   This was a new way for voter suppression  and it was through misappropriating people  s identities online  Nkonde says. Deepfake technology would be another natural tool for malicious actors pretending to be people they are not to disrupt communities and otherwise cause harm. So where do we go from here? Both Nkonde and Gregory have  shared similar recommendations  with MIT Technology Review in the past: companies and researchers who produce tools for deepfakes must also invest in countermeasures  and social-media and search companies should integrate those countermeasures directly into their platforms. Nkonde also urges regulators to act quickly.   Unless government finds a way to protect the rights of consumers  apps like this are going to proliferate  she says.   Technology is not neutral  says Gregory.   This [DeepNude] app is not dual use. It  s single use for a malicious purpose  and it is being created amorally.   We need to really focus on the ethics of creating and sharing generative media tools  he adds.   We should repeatedly call this out.  Ms. Tech Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics The Pentagon has a laser that can identify people from a distance  by their heartbeat The Jetson prototype can pick up on a unique cardiac signature from 200 meters away  even through clothes. by     David Hambling Jun 27  2019 Ms. Tech Everyone  s heart is different. Like the iris or fingerprint  our unique cardiac signature can be used as a way to tell us apart. Crucially  it can be done from a distance. It  s that last point that has intrigued US Special Forces. Other long-range biometric techniques include  gait analysis   which identifies someone by the way he or she walks. This method was supposedly used to identify an infamous ISIS terrorist before a drone strike. But gaits  like  faces   are not necessarily distinctive. An individual  s cardiac signature is unique  though  and unlike faces or gait  it remains constant and cannot be altered or disguised. Long-range detection A new device  developed for the Pentagon after US Special Forces requested it  can identify people without seeing their face: instead it detects their unique cardiac signature with an infrared laser. While it works at 200 meters (219 yards)  longer distances could be possible with a better laser.   I don  t want to say you could do it from space  says Steward Remaly  of the Pentagon  s Combatting Terrorism Technical Support Office    but longer ranges should be possible. Contact infrared sensors are often used to automatically record a patient  s pulse. They work by detecting the changes in reflection of infrared light caused by blood flow. By contrast  the new device  called Jetson  uses a technique known as laser vibrometry to detect the surface movement caused by the heartbeat. This works though typical clothing like a shirt and a jacket (though not thicker clothing such as a winter coat). Sign up for     The Download      your daily dose of what\\'s up in emerging technology Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No The most common way of carrying out remote biometric identification is by face recognition. But this needs good  frontal view of the face  which can be hard to obtain  especially from a drone. Face recognition may also be confused by beards  sunglasses  or headscarves. Cardiac signatures are already used for security identification. The Canadian company  Nymi  has developed a wrist-worn pulse sensor as an alternative to fingerprint identification. The technology has been trialed by the Halifax building society in the UK. Related story Alexa could spot your cardiac arrest  by listening to your breathing A new system that listens for a telltale gasping sound could get you vital help in time. Jetson extends this approach by adapting an off-the shelf device that is usually used to check vibration from a distance in structures such as wind turbines. For Jetson  a special gimbal was added so that an invisible  quarter-size laser spot could be kept on a target. It takes about 30 seconds to get a good return  so at present the device is only effective where the subject is sitting or standing. Better than face recognition Remaly  s team then developed algorithms capable of extracting a cardiac signature from the laser signals. He claims that Jetson can achieve over 95% accuracy under good conditions  and this might be further improved. In practice  it  s likely that Jetson would be used alongside facial recognition or other identification methods. Wenyao Xu of the State University of New York at Buffalo has also developed a remote cardiac sensor  although it works only up to 20 meters away and uses radar. He believes the cardiac approach is far more robust than facial recognition.   Compared with face  cardiac biometrics are more stable and can reach more than 98% accuracy  he says. One glaring limitation is the need for a database of cardiac signatures  but even without this the system has its uses. For example  an insurgent seen in a group planting an IED could later be positively identified from a cardiac signature  even if the person  s name and face are unknown. Biometric data is also routinely collected by US armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan  so cardiac data could be added to that library. In the longer run  this technology could find many more uses  its developers believe. For example  a doctor could scan for arrythmias and other conditions remotely  or hospitals could monitor the condition of patients without having to wire them up to machines.  Artificial Intelligence Jun 26 If you did the Mannequin Challenge  you are now advancing robotics research Cast your mind back to the internet in 2016. Do you have hazy memories of the Mannequin Challenge? Well  the viral YouTube trend has now been used to train a neural network in understanding 3D scenes. The context:  We are naturally good at interpreting 2D videos as 3D scenes  but machines need to be taught how to do it. It  s a useful skill to have: the ability to reconstruct the depth and arrangement of freely moving objects can help robots maneuver in unfamiliar surroundings. That  s why the challenge has long captivated computer-vision researchers  especially in the context of self-driving cars. The data:  To approach this problem  a team at Google AI turned to an  unexpected data set : thousands of YouTube videos of people performing the Mannequin Challenge. (If it happened to pass you by at the time  this involved standing as still as possible while someone moved around you  filming the pose from all angles.) These videos also happen to be a novel source of data for understanding the depth of a 2D image. The method:  The researchers converted 2 000 of the videos into 2D images with high-resolution depth data and used them to train a neural network. It was then able to predict the depth of moving objects in a video at much higher accuracy than was possible with previous state-of-the-art methods. Last week  the researchers were awarded  a best paper honorable mention  at a major computer vision conference. Unknowing participants:  The researchers also released their data set to support future research  meaning that thousands of people who participated in the Mannequin Challenge will unknowingly continue to contribute to the advancement of computer vision and robotics research. While that may come as an uncomfortable surprise to some  this is the rule in AI research rather than the exception. Many of the field  s most foundational data sets  including Fei-Fei Li  s  ImageNet   which kicked off the deep-learning revolution  were compiled from  publicly available data  scraped from Twitter  Wikipedia  Flickr  and other sources. The practice is motivated by the immense amount of data required to train deep-learning algorithms and has only been exacerbated in recent years as researchers produce  ever bigger models  to achieve breakthrough results. Data privacy:  As we have  written before   this data-scraping practice is neither obviously good nor bad but calls into question the norms around consent in the industry. As data becomes increasingly commoditized and monetized  technologists should think about whether the way they  re using someone  s data aligns with the spirit of why it was originally generated and shared.  Getty Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics Gig workers often get an unfair deal. This firm says it  s different. LeadGenius claims to be an online contract company that treats its workers with more respect. Its founder and CEO Prayag Narula tells us why fairness is at its core. by     Will Knight Jun 24  2019 Getty Many AI companies are hiding a dirty secret. Behind the algorithms   an army of humans  toils away  generating training data. Like Lyft and Uber drivers  these employees sometimes work in stressful and otherwise poor conditions. Or they face a race to the bottom in terms of wages  competing for work on platforms where the lowest bid wins the job. Many economists expect this type of work to become more common  too.\\nLeadGenius  a company founded by UC Berkeley researchers who studied online contract work  claims to be different. Its approach and philosophyâ\\x80\\x94including fostering better conditions for its employeesâ\\x80\\x94may offer some valuable lessons about the future of work.\\n\\nThe companyâ\\x80\\x99s founder and CEO  Prayag Narula  met with MIT Technology Reviewâ\\x80\\x99s senior AI editor  Will Knight  to discuss the firmâ\\x80\\x99s effort to improve life as a gig worker.\\n\\nHow do you make sure gig workers are treated fairly? What are the key principles?\\nFairness is hard to define but we have defined three major principles that encapsulate what we think are the right principles.\\n\\nFirst  fair wages. We guarantee hourly wages that are enough to support a small family in the regions we operate. This may be two or three times the minimum wage  and it might mean that people who do the same work in different regions get paid different wages.\\n\\nSecond  cooperation over competition. Whoever makes a lowest bid for a job on UpWork or Fiverr or whoever responds fastest on Uber or Lyft gets to do the work. This basically creates a race to the bottom. During our time at UC Berkeley and beyond we published multiple papers showing that you get better results if people work together and cooperate. So we have built technology  processes and culture that encourages people to work together and support each other.\\n\\nThird  growth opportunities. Most of the gig-economy work is focused on project-based work and doesn\\'t tap into our inherent need to be challenged  appreciated  acknowledged  and to grow. We have built career tracks inside LeadGenius that makes sure that talented hard-working people grow inside the community. You can become a manager  you could even become a full-time employee who gets benefits and equity in the company. About 20% of our full-time people started this way.\\n\\nThere are other ways to look at fairness. We were one of the first organizations to sign the Good Work Code  an initiative by the National Domestic Workers Alliance (NDWA).\\n\\nI feel really compelled to call out companies who hide their human input under the guise of \\'AI\\'. If you are not giving acknowledgment to people for their contribution you are dehumanizing them. This is why I say that even the name \\'Mechanical Turk\\' Amazon gave to its online gig economy service is cruel and disrespectful.\\n\\nPrayag Narula\\nUC BERKELEY\\nWhat are the next steps for building a more socially responsible company?\\nWe have a sophisticated way in which we collect data on our social impact  but if we were to boil it down to one stat  that would be the wages paid worldwide by LeadGenius. We have paid over $10 million in wages so far. We are now planning on investing a lot more in training and collaboration and placing people not just in LeadGenius but outside  too. That way anyone (whether a LeadGenius customer or not) can get access to talented and trained people around the world. We are actively looking for partners for this initiative.\\n\\nOur goal is to pay out $100 million in wages by 2023.\\n\\nWhat does $10 million actually achieve? In other words  how can you measure worker well-being  happiness  and progress more effectively?\\nGreat question. You are absolutely right that $10 million doesnâ\\x80\\x99t say much about the social impact. It is important to understand the context behind it. Every 6 to 9 months we collect data on the economic change that members of our community have seen in their lives because of LeadGenius. We collect data on how many people were unemployed or underemployed before joining LeadGenius (87%). For 25% of our community members  LeadGenius is their sole source of income; for an additional 27%  itâ\\x80\\x99s their largest source of income. And for over 80% of the community members  LeadGenius proceeds are used towards basic needs (food  rent  health care).\\n\\nWe also ask people to share their general opinion about how their life has changed qualitatively. The feedback is almost universally positive. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s a quote from the last survey: â\\x80\\x9cIt gave me confidence  build trust in people. It\\'s a continuous support system not only in terms of monetary aspect but also new things to learn  experience. No matter we\\'re all from different backgroundsâ\\x80\\x94all of us are equally treated  given opportunity to work together in such a great platform.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCompanies need to go beyond eye-catching numbers and put processes in place to understand that impact (positive and negative).\\n\\nDid you see the most recent story about Facebookâ\\x80\\x99s contract moderators? How can big companies like Facebook try to be more ethical  and ensure that its contractors are  too?\\nI did  and honestly it was painful to read. Look  I understand the issues associated with building a large group of contractors and the challenges it represents  but I would blame Cognizant for creating a work culture that toxic and failing to heed the voices of its own people. Making false promises  not being transparent  making people feel trapped  and treating them as replaceable commodities represent rotten company culture gone completely rogue.\\n\\nWhere Facebook and (a lot of other companies) go wrong is that they never vet their vendors for ethical business practices around how they treat their knowledge workers. Essentially what Facebook is saying is that if they donâ\\x80\\x99t employ the people directly  they have no say in their well-being. This is total BS.\\n\\nThe best thing these companies can do is to take the well-being of their and their vendorsâ\\x80\\x99 contractors seriously. We have seen this point brought up again and again in manufacturing  where a lot of companies were accused of essentially using sweatshops. After a huge uproar  company policies were changed around the world. However  we have strangely turned a blind eye toward knowledge workers  who are as prone to bad work conditions and culture as at any sweatshop in Bangladesh or India.\\n\\nIn order to pay workers more  isnâ\\x80\\x99t LeadGenius just moving gig work higher up the food chain? Wonâ\\x80\\x99t that simply replace other jobs with less stable ones?\\nI am not sure that LeadGenius is moving gig work up the food chain so much as reacting to the change. Our broader goal is to make sure that the gig economy model isnâ\\x80\\x99t abused and to create a company that proves treating people right and paying them fair wages makes business sense.\\n\\nMary Gray said in her book Ghost Work that gig economy jobs are not just here to stay but are the future of work. So the gig economy is coming for a lot of â\\x80\\x9cstableâ\\x80\\x9d jobs  including mine and yours. The least we can do is amplify the advantages of these jobs (flexibility  more control  focus on output rather than efforts) and try to balance out the negatives.  How each sub-discipline of machine learning can help fight climate change  where the darker colors represent more opportunities to pursue. Ms. Tech | Thumbnnail: chuttersnap/Unsplash Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning Here are 10 ways AI could help fight climate change Machine learning has the potential to make some real inroads against our biggest threat. by     Karen Hao Jun 20  2019 How each sub-discipline of machine learning can help fight climate change  where the darker colors represent more opportunities to pursue. Ms. Tech | Thumbnnail: chuttersnap/Unsplash Some of the biggest names in AI research have laid out  a road map  suggesting how machine learning can help  save our planet and humanity from imminent peril . The report covers possible machine-learning interventions in 13 domains  from electricity systems to farms and forests to climate prediction. Within each domain  it breaks out the contributions for various subdisciplines within machine learning  including computer vision  natural-language processing  and reinforcement learning. Recommendations are also divided into three categories:   high leverage for problems well suited to machine learning where such interventions may have an especially great impact;   long-term for solutions that won  t have payoffs until 2040; and   high risk for pursuits that have less certain outcomes  either because the technology isn  t mature or because not enough is known to assess the consequences. Many of the recommendations also summarize existing efforts that are already happening but not yet at scale. Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No The report  s compilation was led by David Rolnick  a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania  and advised by several high-profile figures  including Andrew Ng  the cofounder of Google Brain and a leading AI entrepreneur and educator; Demis Hassabis  the founder and CEO of DeepMind; Jennifer Chayes  the managing director of Microsoft Research; and Yoshua Bengio  who recently won the Turing Award for his contributions to the field. While the researchers offer a very comprehensive list of some of the major areas where machine learning can contribute  they also note that it is not a silver bullet. Ultimately  policy will be the main driver for effective large-scale climate action. Here are just 10 of the   high leverage recommendations from the report. Read the full version of it  here . 1. Improve predictions of how much electricity we need If we  re going to rely on more renewable energy sources  utilities will need  better ways of predicting  how much energy is needed  in real time and over the long term. Algorithms already exist that can forecast energy demand  but they could be improved by taking into account finer local weather and climate patterns or household behavior. Efforts to make the algorithms more explainable could also help utility operators interpret their outputs and use them in scheduling when to bring renewable sources online. 2. Discover new materials\\nScientists need to develop materials that store  harvest  and use energy more efficiently  but the process of discovering new materials is typically slow and imprecise. Machine learning can accelerate things by finding  designing  and evaluating new chemical structures with the desired properties. This could  for example  help create solar fuels  which can store energy from sunlight  or identify more efficient carbon dioxide absorbents or structural materials that take a lot less carbon to create. The latter materials could one day replace steel and cementâ\\x80\\x94the production of which accounts for nearly 10% of all global greenhouse-gas emissions.\\n\\n3. Optimize how freight is routed\\nShipping goods around the world is a complex and often highly inefficient process that involves the interplay of different shipment sizes  different types of transportation  and a changing web of origins and destinations. Machine learning could help find ways to bundle together as many shipments as possible and minimize the total number of trips. Such a system would also be more resilient to transportation disruptions.\\n\\n4. Lower barriers to electric-vehicle adoption\\nElectric vehicles  a key strategy for decarbonizing transportation  face several adoption challenges where machine learning could help. Algorithms can improve battery energy management to increase the mileage of each charge and reduce â\\x80\\x9crange anxiety â\\x80\\x9d for example. They can also model and predict aggregate charging behavior to help grid operators meet and manage their load.\\n\\n5. Help make buildings more efficient\\nIntelligent control systems can dramatically reduce a buildingâ\\x80\\x99s energy consumption by taking weather forecasts  building occupancy  and other environmental conditions into account to adjust the heating  cooling  ventilation  and lighting needs in an indoor space. A smart building could also communicate directly with the grid to reduce how much power it is using if thereâ\\x80\\x99s a scarcity of low-carbon electricity supply at any given time.\\n\\n6. Create better estimates of how much energy we are consuming\\nMany regions of the world have little to no data on their energy consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions  which can be a major obstacle to designing and implementing effective mitigation strategies. Computer vision techniques can extract building footprints and characteristics from satellite imagery to feed machine-learning algorithms that can estimate city-level energy consumption. The same techniques could also identify which buildings should be retrofitted to maximize their efficiency.\\n\\n7. Optimize supply chains\\nIn the same way that machine learning can optimize shipping routes  it can also minimize inefficiencies and carbon emissions in the supply chains of the food  fashion  and consumer goods industries. Better predictions of supply and demand should significantly reduce production and transportation waste  while targeted recommendations   for low-carbon products could encourage more environmentally friendly consumption.\\n\\n8. Make precision agriculture possible at scale\\nMuch of modern-day agriculture is dominated by monoculture  the practice of producing a single crop on a large swath of land. This approach makes it easier for farmers to manage their fields with tractors and other basic automated tools  but it also strips the soil of nutrients and reduces its productivity. As a result  many farmers rely heavily on nitrogen-based fertilizers  which can convert into nitrous oxide  a greenhouse gas 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Robots run on machine-learning software could help farmers manage a mix of crops more effectively at scale  while algorithms could help farmers predict what crops to plant when  regenerating the health of their land and reducing the need for fertilizers.\\n\\n9. Improve deforestation tracking\\nDeforestation contributes to roughly 10% of global greenhouse-gas emissions  but tracking and preventing it is usually a tedious manual process that takes place on the ground. Satellite imagery and computer vision can automatically analyze the loss of tree cover at a much greater scale  and sensors on the ground  combined with algorithms for detecting chainsaw sounds  can help local law enforcement stop illegal activity.\\n\\n10. Nudge consumers to change how we shop\\nTechniques that advertisers have successfully used to target consumers can be used to help us behave in more environmentally aware ways. Consumers could receive tailored interventions to promote their enrollment in energy saving programs  for example.  Artificial Intelligence Jun 14 Deepfakes may be a useful tool for spies A spy may have used an AI-generated face to deceive and connect with targets on social media. The news:  A LinkedIn profile under the name Katie Jones has been identified by  the AP  as a likely front for AI-enabled espionage. The persona is networked with several high-profile figures in Washington  including a deputy assistant secretary of state  a senior aide to a senator  and an economist being considered for a seat on the Federal Reserve. But what  s most fascinating is the profile image: it demonstrates all the hallmarks of a deepfake  according to several experts who reviewed it. Easy target:  LinkedIn has long been a magnet for spies because it gives easy access to people in powerful circles. Agents will routinely send out tens of thousands of connection requests  pretending to be different people. Only last month  a retired CIA officer was sentenced to 20 years in prison for leaking classified information to a Chinese agent who made contact by posing as a recruiter on the platform. Weak defense:  So why did   Katie Jones take advantage of AI? Because it removes an important line of defense for detecting impostors: doing a reverse image search on the profile photo. It  s yet another way that deepfakes are eroding our trust in truth as they rapidly advance into the mainstream.

But being able to analyze and recognize actions in footage could prove useful for applications like video editing. So Amir Ziai  a Stanford student at the time of research and now a senior data scientist at Netflix  took it upon himself to advance the state of the art  specifically in  detecting Hollywood kissing scenes . The study may seem rather light-hearted or silly  but it has important implications. Ziai selected a subset of 100 movies and labeled their various non-kissing and kissing scenes between 10 and 20 seconds in length. He then extracted image and audio stills for every second of each scene  and used them to train a machine-learning algorithm. The resulting model was able to identify which seconds depicted kissing and group them into scenes  achieving a high level of accuracy. The study shows how quickly the means of analyzing footage for specific  even intimate  actions have advanced. Couple that with surveillance footage  and the implications quickly turn Orwellian. In fact  in a  new report   the ACLU sounded the alarm on a future in which camera owners would be able to rapidly identify unusual behavior or seek out embarrassing moments. Like deepfakes  it  s yet another example of a situation where technologists should think about the consequences of their work.

Share Link Tagged Face Recognition    AI Ethics Author Karen Hao Image PeopleImages/Getty Share Link Tagged Face Recognition    AI Ethics  Artificial Intelligence Jun 7 You can train an AI to fake UN speeches in just 13 hours Deep-learning techniques have made it easier and easier for anyone to forge convincing misinformation. But just how easy? Two researchers at Global Pulse  an initiative of the United Nations  decided to find out. In a  new paper   they used only open-source tools and data to show how quickly they could get a fake UN speech generator up and running. They used a readily available language model that had been trained on text from Wikipedia and fine-tuned it on all the speeches given by political leaders at the UN General Assembly from 1970 to 2015. Thirteen hours and $7.80 later (spent on cloud computing resources)  their model was spitting out realistic speeches on a wide variety of sensitive and high-stakes topics from nuclear disarmament to refugees. The researchers tested the model on three types of prompts: general topics (e.g.   climate change  Ã¹)  opening lines from the UN Secretary-General  s remarks  and inflammatory phrases (e.g.   immigrants are to blame    Ã¹). They found that outputs from the first category closely matched the style and cadence of real UN speeches roughly 90% of the time. Likely because of the diplomatic nature of the training data  outputs from the third category required more work to generate  producing convincing outputs about 60% of the time. The case study demonstrates  the speed and ease  with which it  s now possible to disseminate fake news  generate hate speech  and impersonate high-profile figures  with disturbing implications. The researchers conclude that a greater global effort is needed to work on ways of detecting and responding to AI-generated content.

Behind the â\\x80\\x9cmagicâ\\x80\\x9d of its ability to interpret 26 languages is a huge team of linguists  working as subcontractors  who must tediously label the training data for it to work. They earn low wages and are routinely forced to work unpaid overtime. Their concerns over working conditions have been repeatedly dismissed.\\n\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s just one story among dozens that have begun to peel back the curtain on how the artificial-intelligence industry operates. Human workers donâ\\x80\\x99t just label the data that makes AI work. Sometimes humans workers are the artificial intelligence. Behind Facebookâ\\x80\\x99s content-moderating AI are thousands of content moderators; behind Amazon Alexa is a global team of transcribers; and behind Google Duplex are sometimes very human callers mimicking the AI that mimics humans. Artificial intelligence doesnâ\\x80\\x99t run on magic pixie dust. It runs on invisible laborers who train algorithms relentlessly until theyâ\\x80\\x99ve automated their own jobs away.\\nIn their new book Ghost Work: How to Stop Silicon Valley from Building a New Global Underclass  anthropologist Mary Gray and computer scientist Siddharth Suri argue that you and I could be next.\\n\\nI caught up with Gray this week to discuss why people turn to ghost work  how their invisibility leaves them more vulnerable to terrible working conditions  and how we can make this new form of work more sustainable.\\n\\nThe following has been edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nMIT Technology Review: How do you define ghost work?\\nMary Gray: Itâ\\x80\\x99s any work that could beâ\\x80\\x94at least in partâ\\x80\\x94sourced  scheduled  managed  shipped  and built through an application programming interface  the internet  and maybe a sprinkle of artificial intelligence. It arguably becomes ghost work when the proposition is that there are no humans involved in that loop  that itâ\\x80\\x99s just a matter of software working its magic.\\n\\nThe cover of the book Ghost Work\\nCOURTESY OF HOUGHTON MIFFLIN HARCOURT\\nSo the definition really hinges on how the end product or service is marketed.\\nYeah. The work  or the output  itself is not inherently bad or good. It is specifically the work conditions that make it bad or good. Providing a service like those we describe in the book  captioning a translation or cleaning training data for training algorithmsâ\\x80\\x94that work is often written off as mundane drudgery. Think of content moderation right now and how itâ\\x80\\x99s sensationalized as something horrific and terrible to do. From the perspective of the workers  itâ\\x80\\x99s a job. And itâ\\x80\\x99s a job that actually takes quite a bit of creativity and insight and judgment. The problem is that the work conditions donâ\\x80\\x99t recognize how important the person is to that process. It diminishes their work and really creates work conditions that are unsustainable.\\n\\nCompanies have a long history of exploiting the labor of less privileged communities. You bring up the example of the fashion industry in your book. Is there something particularly distinct about ghost work that creates even more cause for concern?\\nIn some ways  ghost work is indeed a continuation of the mistreatment of many working people. To me  the dramatic shift is weâ\\x80\\x99ve never quite had industries so completely sell contract labor as automationâ\\x80\\x94not just to make it difficult for a consumer to see the supply chain as we can in textiles  in food  and in agriculture  but also to say that thereâ\\x80\\x99s really not a person working here at all. I get chills just thinking: if that is taken to every sector that effectively sells information services  thatâ\\x80\\x99s a lot of people and their participation in the economy erased. That also makes it so difficult for workers to organize and to claw back power.\\n\\nThis is really about the dismantlement of employment.\\n\\nMary Gray\\n\\nIn the textile industry  what makes it somewhat possible to organize is that you have people located in the same building. Itâ\\x80\\x99s possible for them to see common cause and say  â\\x80\\x9cThis isnâ\\x80\\x99t just happening to me.â\\x80\\x9d With ghost work  weâ\\x80\\x99ve never had a workforce so completely globally distributed. That creates such a different challenge for the workers  both to draw attention to the issue among consumers and to see that theyâ\\x80\\x99re not alone.\\n\\nBecause they donâ\\x80\\x99t know about each other  theyâ\\x80\\x99re unable to demand good working conditions. And because society doesnâ\\x80\\x99t know about them  thereâ\\x80\\x99s no accountability.\\nExactly. And in many ways  this is whatâ\\x80\\x99s coming home to roost. Many industries have always relied on contingent workers. But now weâ\\x80\\x99ve completely built an economy around relying on contingent workers. There is no more â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m just filling in the holes here with contractors  and my full-time workers do most of the work.â\\x80\\x9d That is radical. We should really take pause. So much of the mainstream of our economy is about having an office job  and thatâ\\x80\\x99s about to get eliminated. There isnâ\\x80\\x99t a version of this in which you advance to full-time  more stable on-demand work. If we donâ\\x80\\x99t catch it now  it all becomes ghost work. This is really about the dismantlement of employment.\\n\\nYeah  the thing that most surprised me about your book is how many people who are highly educated are doing ghost work. The fact that so many people with masterâ\\x80\\x99s degrees are turning to ghost work really indicates how far weâ\\x80\\x99ve allowed this trend to grow.\\nThe great paradox of on-demand information services is that they cannot be easily automated. Any work involving serving someone elseâ\\x80\\x99s needs requires quite a bit of intelligence and attentiveness  so a college education has become the new bar of universal education  and the people participating in the loop have become fundamentally necessary. But we clearly donâ\\x80\\x99t know how to value that.\\n\\nSo what are the large-scale changes that you think need to happen in order for us not to all be swallowed by ghost work?\\nBeing reliant on contract work essentially means we are reliant on people being available. So the number one intervention both workers and businesses need is to rebuild our social contract for employment around the value of availability. This would assume that all working-age adults have the potential to participate in our economy and are valuable precisely because they are willing to bring the distinctly human capacity to respond to peopleâ\\x80\\x99s requests for help to projects.\\n\\nRight now we spend a lot of energy trying to figure out how to bring people into full-time employment  particularly in the US  to secure benefits. We should let go of trying to secure benefits through a work site. Instead we should ask  â\\x80\\x9cWhat are the benefits people need to be able to participate in this type of economy?â\\x80\\x9d They need a few things: they need access to health care; they need paid time off; they need access to healthy co-working spaces; they need colleagues and networks of peers  and access to continuing education to learn how to advance and expand their capacities.\\n\\nBeyond that  what most people need to make contract work habitable is the ability to control three things: their time  their opportunities  and chances to contribute to different networks of collaborators who will teach them new things that they can apply to the next project. If we equip them to control their participation in an economyâ\\x80\\x94make it possible to step in and out of the market as needed to get sick  start families  learn new capacities to bring to different projectsâ\\x80\\x94they will be better able to bring their capacities to contract work.  Tempe Police Department Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics When algorithms mess up  the nearest human gets the blame A look at historical case studies shows us how we handle the liability of automated systems. by     Karen Hao May 28  2019 Tempe Police Department Earlier this month  Bloomberg  published an article  about an unfolding lawsuit over investments lost by an algorithm. A Hong Kong tycoon lost more than $20 million after entrusting part of his fortune to an automated platform. Without a legal framework to sue the technology  he placed the blame on the nearest human: the man who sold it to him. It  s the first known case over automated investment losses  but not the first involving the liability of algorithms. In March of 2018  a self-driving Uber  struck and killed  a pedestrian in Tempe  Arizona  sending another case to court. A year later  Uber was  exonerated  of all criminal liability  but the safety driver could face charges of vehicular manslaughter instead. Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No Both cases tackle one of the central questions we face as automated systems trickle into every aspect of society: Who or what deserves the blame when an algorithm causes harm? Who or what actually gets the blame is a different yet equally important question. Madeleine Clare Elish  a researcher at Data & Society and a cultural anthropologist by training  has spent the last few years studying the latter question to see how it can help answer the former. To do so  she has looked back at historical case studies. While modern AI systems haven  t been around for long  the questions surrounding their liability are not new. The self-driving Uber crash parallels the 2009 crash of Air France flight 447  for example  and a look at how we treated liability then offers clues for what we might do now. In that tragic accident  the plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean en route from Brazil to France  killing all 228 people on board. The plane  s automated system was designed to be a completely   foolproof  capable of handling nearly all scenarios except for the rare edge cases when it needed a human pilot to take over. In that sense  the pilots were much like today  s safety drivers for self-driving cars  meant to passively monitor the flight the vast majority of the time but leap into action during extreme scenarios. Related story Congress wants to protect you from biased algorithms  deepfakes  and other bad AI Only a few legislators really know what they  re talking about  but it  s a start. What happened the night of the crash is  at this point  a well-known story. About an hour and a half into the flight  the plane  s air speed sensors stopped working because of ice formation. After the autopilot system transferred control back to the pilots  confusion and miscommunication led the plane to stall. While one of the pilots attempted to reverse the stall by pointing the plane  s nose down  the other  likely in a panic  raised the nose to continue climbing. The system was designed for one pilot to be in control at all times  however  and didn  t provide any signals or haptic feedback to indicate which one was actually in control and what the other was doing. Ultimately  the plane climbed to an angle so steep that the system deemed it invalid and stopped providing feedback entirely. The pilots  flying completely blind  continued to fumble until the plane plunged into the sea. In a  recent paper   Elish examined the aftermath of the tragedy and identified an important pattern in the way the public came to understand what happened. While a federal investigation of the incident concluded that a mix of poor systems design and insufficient pilot training had caused the catastrophic failure  the public quickly latched onto a narrative that placed the sole blame on the latter. Media portrayals  in particular  perpetuated the belief that the sophisticated autopilot system bore no fault in the matter despite significant human-factors research demonstrating that humans have always been rather inept at leaping into emergency situations at the last minute with a level head and clear mind. Humans act like a \"liability sponge.\" Madeleine Clare Elish In other case studies  Elish found the same pattern to hold true: even in a highly automated system where humans have limited control of its behavior  they still bear most of the blame for its failures. Elish calls this phenomenon a   moral crumple zone.   While the crumple zone in a car is meant to protect the human driver  she writes in her paper    the moral crumple zone protects the integrity of the technological system  at the expense of the nearest human operator. Humans act like a   liability sponge  she says  absorbing all legal and moral responsibility in algorithmic accidents no matter how little or unintentionally they are involved. This pattern offers important insight into the troubling way we speak about the liability of modern AI systems. In the immediate aftermath of the Uber accident  headlines pointed fingers at Uber  but less than a few days later  the narrative  shifted  to focus on the distraction of the driver.   We need to start asking who bears the risk of [tech companies  ] technological experiments  says Elish. Safety drivers and other human operators often have little power or influence over the design of the technology platforms they interact with. Yet in the current regulatory vacuum  they will continue to pay the steepest cost. Regulators should also have more nuanced conversations about what kind of framework would help distribute liability fairly.   They need to think carefully about regulating sociotechnical systems and not just algorithmic black boxes  Elish says. In other words  they should consider whether the system  s design works within the context it  s operating in and whether it sets up human operators along the way for failure or success. Self-driving cars  for example  should be regulated in a way that factors in whether the role safety drivers are being asked to play is reasonable.   At stake in the concept of the moral crumple zone is not only how accountability may be distributed in any robotic or autonomous system  she writes    but also how the value and potential of humans may be allowed to develop in the context of human-machine teams.

Share Link Tagged AI Ethics    Tech Policy  Unsplash Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics The World Economic Forum wants to develop global rules for AI Can the world  s great powers agree on rules of the road for artificial intelligence? by     Will Knight May 28  2019 Unsplash This week  AI experts  politicians  and CEOs will gather to ask an important question: Can the United States  China  or anyone else agree on how artificial intelligence should be used and controlled? The World Economic Forum  the international organization that brings together the world  s rich and powerful to discuss global issues at Davos each year  will host the event in San Francisco. The WEF will also announce the creation of an   AI Council designed to find common ground on policy between nations that increasingly seem at odds over the power and the potential of AI and other emerging technologies (see    Trump  s feud with Huawei and China could lead to the Balkanization of tech   Ã¹). The issue is of paramount importance given the current geopolitical winds. AI is widely viewed as critical to national competitiveness and geopolitical advantage. The effort to find common ground is also important considering the way technology is driving a wedge between countries  especially the United States and its big economic rival  China.   Many see AI through the lens of economic and geopolitical competition  says  Michael Sellitto   deputy director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI.   [They] tend to create barriers that preserve their perceived strategic advantages  in access to data or research  for example. Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No A number of nations have announced AI plans that promise to prioritize funding  development  and application of the technology. But efforts to build consensus on how AI should be governed have been limited. This April  the EU released  guidelines for the ethical use of AI . The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)  a coalition of countries dedicated to promoting democracy and economic development  this month  announced a set of AI principles  built upon its own objectives. It would be a lot more significant (and surprising) to find common ground between the United States  China  and the rest of the world when it comes to AI. But the WEF effort is clearly designed to do that. This week  s event will host dozens of experts  executives  and policymakers. In attendance will be representatives from the United Nations and Unicef  along with companies including Microsoft  IBM  the Chinese insurance and technology giant Ping An  and the Canadian AI consultancy Element AI. The meeting will also feature prominent academics and politicians from a handful of smaller countries. Tellingly  the two chairs of the WEF  s AI council will be  Brad Smith   president of Microsoft and head of the company  s legal and corporate affairs teams  and  Kai-Fu Lee   a prominent Chinese AI expert and investor who has written a book called  AI Superpowers   outlining China  s rising technology prowess .   The role that the forum plays is that of an impartial international organization  says Kay Firth-Butterfield  head of AI and machine learning at the WEF. She says the new council will seek to identify the three most important issues in AI  which she thinks will be how the technology may affect the future of work; how research in AI could benefit emerging countries; and what specific use cases of the technology will emerge.   We are looking for areas where we need to bridge so called   governance gaps    she says. One specific use of AI that seems destined to cause friction is surveillance. Civil rights groups in the US have pushed for greater regulation of face recognition in particular  and some cities have obliged  but the there is little resistance to this application in China.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDifferent cultures have different values  and AI is a technology that can encode values â\\x80\\x9d says Jack Clark  who will attend the event on behalf of OpenAI  an AI company in San Francisco backed by big-name Silicon Valley investors. â\\x80\\x9cI think itâ\\x80\\x99s going to be challenging at first to agree on things like â\\x80\\x98What values should we encode into a system?â\\x80\\x99 from a global perspective.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nEven so  many may see the new AI council as a valuable and necessary step at a time when a technological cold war is brewing. â\\x80\\x9cOne thing that seems like an unalloyed good is having a bunch of people from different cultures and contexts come together and talk â\\x80\\x9d says Clark.   Tsjisse Talsma Artificial Intelligence AI researchers want to study AI the same way social scientists study humans Maybe we don  t need to look inside the black box after all. We just need to watch how machines behave  instead by     Karen Hao Apr 29  2019 Tsjisse Talsma Much ink has been spilled on the black-box nature of AI systems  and how it makes us uncomfortable that we often can  t understand why they reach the decisions they do. As algorithms have come to mediate everything from our social and cultural to economic and political interactions  computer scientists have attempted to respond to rising demands for their explainability by developing technical methods to understand their behaviors. But a group of researchers from academia and industry are now arguing that we don  t need to penetrate these black boxes in order to understand  and thus control  their effect on our lives. After all  these are not the first inscrutable black boxes we  ve come across.   We\\'ve developed scientific methods to study black boxes for hundreds of years now  but these methods have primarily been applied to [living beings] up to this point  says Nick Obradovich  an MIT Media Lab researcher and co-author of a  new paper  published last week in Nature. â\\x80\\x9cWe can leverage many of the same tools to study the new black box AI systems.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe paperâ\\x80\\x99s authors  a diverse group of researchers from industry and academia  propose to create a new academic discipline called â\\x80\\x9cmachine behavior.â\\x80\\x9d It approaches studying AI systems in the same way weâ\\x80\\x99ve always studied animals and humans: through empirical observation and experimentation.\\n\\nIn this way a machine behavorist is to a computer scientist what a social scientist is to a neuroscientist. The former looks to understand how an agentâ\\x80\\x94whether artificial or biologicalâ\\x80\\x94behaves in its habitat  when coexisting in groups  and when interacting with other intelligent agents. The latter seeks to dissect the decision-making mechanics behind those behaviors.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re seeing the rise of machines with agency  machines that are actors making decisions and taking actions autonomously â\\x80\\x9d Iyad Rahwan  another Media Lab researcher and lead author on the paper  said in a blog post accompanying the publication. Thus they need to be studied â\\x80\\x9cas a new class of actors with their own behavioral patterns and ecology.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean to suggest that AI systems have developed some kind of free will. (They certainly have not; theyâ\\x80\\x99re only glorified math models.) But it is meant to move away from viewing AI systems as passive tools that can be assessed purely through their technical architecture  performance  and capabilities. They should instead be considered as active actors that change and influence their environments and the people and machines around them.\\n\\nSo  what would this even look like? A machine behaviorist might interrogate  for example  the impact of voice assistants on a childâ\\x80\\x99s personality development. Or they might examine how online dating algorithms have changed how people meet and fall in love. Ultimately  they would study the emergent properties that arise from many humans and machines coexisting and collaborating together.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe are all one giant human-machine system â\\x80\\x9d says Obradovich. â\\x80\\x9cWe need to acknowledge that and start studying it that way.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s important to note that most of these ideas arenâ\\x80\\x99t new. Roboticists  for example  have long studied human-computer interaction. And the field of science  technology  and society have whatâ\\x80\\x99s known as the â\\x80\\x9cactor-network theory â\\x80\\x9d a framework for describing everything in the social and natural worldsâ\\x80\\x94both humans and algorithmsâ\\x80\\x94as actors that somehow relate to one another. But for the most part  each of these efforts have been siloed in separate disciplines. Bringing them together under one umbrella helps align their goals  formalize a common language  and foster interdisciplinary collaborations. â\\x80\\x9cIt will help us find each other â\\x80\\x9d Obradovich says.\\n\\nDespite being in a distinct discipline from AI researchers  machine behaviorists should still work closely with them. As the latter discover new ways AI systems behave and affect people  the former can bring those learnings to bear on the systemâ\\x80\\x99s designs. The more each discipline can take advantage of the otherâ\\x80\\x99s expertise  the more they will be able to ensure that artificial agents benefit humans rather than harm them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe need the expertise of scientists from across all behavioral and computational disciplines â\\x80\\x9d Obradovich says. â\\x80\\x9cFiguring out how to live with machines is a problem too vast for any one discipline to solve alone.â\\x80\\x9d  Artificial Intelligence Apr 23 How to hide from the AI surveillance state with a color printout AI-powered video technology is becoming ubiquitous  tracking our faces and bodies through stores  offices  and public spaces. In some countries the technology constitutes a powerful new layer of policing and government surveillance. Fortunately  as some researchers from the Belgian university KU Leuven   have just shown   you can often hide from an AI video system with the aid of a simple color printout. Who said that?  The researchers showed that the image they designed can hide a whole person from an AI-powered computer-vision system. They demonstrated it on a popular open-source object recognition system called  YoLo(v2) . Hide and seek:  The trick could conceivably let crooks hide from security cameras  or offer dissidents a way to dodge government scrutiny.   What our work proves is that it is possible to bypass camera surveillance systems using adversarial patches  says  Wiebe Van Ranst   one of the authors. Get lost:  Van Ranst says it shouldn  t be too hard to adapt the approach to off-the-shelf video surveillance systems.   At the moment we also need to know which detector is in use. What we  d like to do in the future is generate a patch that works on multiple detectors at the same time  he told MIT Technology Review.   If this works  chances are high that the patch will also work on the detector that is in use in the surveillance system. Fool  s errand:  The deception demonstrated by the Belgian team exploits what  s known as adversarial machine learning. Most computer vision relies on training a (convolutional) neural network to recognize different things by feeding it examples and tweaking its parameters until it classifies objects correctly. By feeding examples into a trained deep neural net and monitoring the output  it is possible to infer what types of images confuse or fool the system. Eyes everywhere:  The work is significant because AI is increasingly found in everyday surveillance cameras and software. It  s even being used to obviate the need for a checkout line in some experimental stores  including  ones operated by Amazon . And in China the technology is emerging as a powerful new means of catching criminals as well as  more troublingly   tracking certain ethnic groups .

In an e-mail circulated internally within Google and  obtained by Wired   Meredith Whittaker  who leads Google  s Open Research and cofounded the research institute AI Now  wrote that after the ethics board  s dissolution  she was informed that her role would be   changed dramatically.   I  m told that to remain at the company I will have to abandon my work on AI ethics and the AI Now Institute  she said. Since its founding  AI Now has become an influential cornerstone of research on AI ethics and social impact  releasing reports and hosting annual summits that have sparked vigorous debate within the rest of the field.   Meredith [...] has been a real pioneer & thought leader on AI ethics  especially when it comes to ML bias  diversity  & inclusion  Franâ\\x88\\x9aÃ\\x9fois Chollet  a leading deep-learning expert at Google   wrote  on Twitter.   I believe that her work is critical to Google  s mission  as an AI-first company [and...] I hope that she will be able to carry on her important work. In a statement  a Google spokesperson denied the allegations:   Employees and teams are regularly and commonly given new assignments  or reorganized  to keep pace with evolving business needs. There has been no retaliation here. To have more stories like this delivered directly to your inbox   sign up  for our Webby-nominated AI newsletter The Algorithm. It\\'s free.

Women account for only 18% of authors at leading AI conferences  20% of AI professorships  and 15% and 10% of research staff at Facebook and Google  respectively. Racial diversity is even worse: black workers represent only 2.5% of Google  s entire workforce and 4% of Facebook  s and Microsoft  s. No data is available for transgender people and other gender minorities  but it  s unlikely the trend is being bucked there either. This is deeply troubling when the influence of the industry has dramatically grown to affect everything from hiring and housing to criminal justice and the military. Along the way  the technology has automated the  biases  of its creators to alarming effect:  devaluing women  s râ\\x88\\x9aÂ©sumâ\\x88\\x9aÂ©s    perpetuating employment and housing discrimination   and enshrining racist  policing practices  and  prison convictions . These consequences will only worsen without a different approach to fixing the problem  says a  new report  out this week from the research institute AI Now. Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No   The problem of a lack of diversity in tech [...] has reached a new and urgent inflection point  said Meredith Whittaker  the institute  s cofounder  on a press call accompanying the report.   Millions of people are feeling the effects of these tools and are affected by any AI bias that gets baked into them. The AI Now team identify two main reasons why efforts to address a lack of diversity have failed. First  there  s a heavy emphasis on increasing   women in tech and less on improving diversity of race  gender  and other qualities. Second  there  s a disproportionate focus on   fixing the pipeline  the idea of increasing the number of candidates from underrepresented groups that flow from schools to industry. This tends to underestimate other systemic disadvantages that prevent women and minorities from staying in the field  such as harassment  unfair compensation  and imbalances of power. The researchers offer several recommendations for improving workplace diversity in a more comprehensive way. These include measures aimed at closing the pay and opportunity gap  increasing diversity at the leadership levels across departments  and changing the incentive structures for company executives to hire and retain workers from underrepresented groups. But the problem also runs deeper than hiring and compensation practices  says Jessie Daniels  a researcher at Data & Society  who studies the intersection of racism and technology and was not involved in the report. The tech industry was fundamentally built on the ethos that technology exists independently of society  she says:   In the early   90s  there was this idea that the internet was going to release us from things like race and gender and infirmity; the idea that we were going to go to this place called   cyberspace   where we wouldn  t have to think about embodiment or identity anymore.  That idea has stayed with the industry to this day and is the root of both the repeated failures to increase employee diversity and the repeated scandals around AI bias. Tech companies are built  and tech products are designed  with a   fantasy belief that they exist independently of the sexism  racism  and societal context around them.   That  s not a bug  Daniels says.   It  s a feature. Share Link Tagged AI Ethics    Artificial Intelligence    Machine Learning Author Karen Hao Popular 0   1   .

Meet America  s newest military giant: Amazon 0   3    Artificial Intelligence Apr 9 What you may not understand about China  s AI scene Jeff Ding  a researcher at the University of Oxford who studies China  s AI development  shared some recent  reflections  on the most important things he  s learned in the past year. They offer a great snapshot into the current state of the industry  so I  ve summarized them briefly below. #1. The Chinese- and English-speaking AI communities have an asymmetrical understanding of each other.  Most Chinese researchers can read English  and nearly all major research developments in the Western world are immediately translated into Chinese  but the reverse is not true. Therefore  the Chinese research community has a much  deeper understanding  than the English-speaking one of what  s happening on both sides of the aisle. As China  s AI industry continues to grow  this could prove a major disadvantage for people in the West. #2. Westerners have a hyped-up view of China  s AI capabilities.  The exaggeration is fanned partly by the media and partly by Western actors deliberately using an   AI arms race narrative to spur forward their agendas. But Westerners also lack a genuine understanding of the technical skills and capacity of Chinese companies. A few deep dives from Chinese writers have reported that  most of   China  s AI giants  are much less impressive than they seem  with less-sophisticated algorithms and smaller research teams than commonly believed. #3. The Chinese government sees AI as a tool for social governance.  Security companies account for the highest share of the top 100 AI companies  according to a  report  from Chinese consulting firm Yiou Intelligence. These include facial-recognition startups and companies that supply security and safety-monitoring platforms. Some of these firms have been directly involved in the government  s mass surveillance of Xinjiang  the autonomous region where members of China  s ethnic minority group  the Uighurs  are concentrated. Other companies are fueling China  s export of surveillance tech to Central Asia and beyond. #4. AI research has benefited greatly from China-US collaboration.  Historically  talent and ideas have flown freely between American and Chinese companies  challenging notions of what it means to be an American or Chinese. Take  for example   Microsoft Research Asia  (MSRA)  Microsoft\\'s hub in Beijing and the largest center outside its headquarters. In its 20-year history  MSRA has played as essential a role in pushing the boundaries of Microsoft  s research efforts as it has in fostering China  s AI ecosystem. Projects like XiaoIce  the company  s wildly popular chatbot in China  take advantage of the country  s enormous user base to refine the company  s AI capabilities. MSRA has also trained thousands of talented Chinese researchers who have gone on to work at many of the country  s major AI companies. #5. Chinese people care about AI ethics.  While it may be true that Chinese and American citizens have differing views on privacy  it  s false to say that the former don  t care about it at all. Tech giants have been mired in  privacy infringement controversies   and local governments have  filed suits  against companies for violating data protections. Chinese philosophers and academics have also elevated broader conversations on ethics into the national discourse. This story originally appeared in our Webby-nominated AI newsletter The Algorithm.

Just last week  the tech giant was  sued  by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development over the way it let advertisers purposely target their ads by race  gender  and religion  all protected classes under US law. The company  announced  that it would stop allowing this. But  new evidence  shows that Facebook  s algorithm  which automatically decides who is shown an ad  carries out the same discrimination anyway  serving up ads to over two billion users on the basis of their demographic information. Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No A team led by Muhammad Ali and Piotr Sapiezynski at Northeastern University ran a series of otherwise identical ads with slight variations in available budget  headline  text  or image. They found that those subtle tweaks had significant impacts on the audience reached by each ad  most notably when the ads were for jobs or real estate. Postings for preschool teachers and secretaries  for example  were shown to a higher fraction of women  while postings for janitors and taxi drivers were shown to a higher proportion of minorities. Ads about homes for sale were also shown to more white users  while ads for rentals were shown to more minorities. !function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\" function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\")}})}();   We  ve made important changes to our ad-targeting tools and know that this is only a first step  a Facebook spokesperson  said  in a statement in response to the findings.   We  ve been looking at our ad-delivery system and have engaged industry leaders  academics  and civil rights experts on this very topic  and we  re exploring more changes. In some ways  this shouldn  t be surprising  bias in recommendation algorithms has been a known issue for many years. In 2013  for example  Latanya Sweeney  a professor of government and technology at Harvard  published a paper that showed the implicit racial discrimination of Google  s ad-serving algorithm. The issue goes back to how these algorithms fundamentally work. All of them are based on  machine learning   which finds patterns in massive amounts of data and reapplies them to make decisions. There are many ways that  bias  can trickle in during this process  but the two most apparent in Facebook  s case relate to issues during problem framing and data collection. !function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\" function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\")}})}(); Bias occurs during problem framing when the objective of a machine-learning model is misaligned with the need to avoid discrimination. Facebook  s advertising tool allows advertisers to select from three optimization objectives: the number of views an ad gets  the number of clicks and amount of engagement it receives  and the quantity of sales it generates. But those business goals have nothing to do with  say  maintaining equal access to housing. As a result  if the algorithm discovered that it could earn more engagement by showing more white users homes for purchase  it would end up discriminating against black users. !function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\" function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\")}})}(); Bias occurs during data collection when the training data reflects existing prejudices. Facebook  s advertising tool bases its optimization decisions on the historical preferences that people have demonstrated. If more minorities engaged with ads for rentals in the past  the machine-learning model will identify that pattern and reapply it in perpetuity. Once again  it will blindly plod down the road of employment and housing discrimination  without being explicitly told to do so. While these behaviors in machine learning have been studied for quite some time  the new study does offer a more direct look into the sheer scope of its impact on people  s access to housing and employment opportunities.   These findings are explosive! Christian Sandvig  the director of the Center for Ethics  Society  and Computing at the University of Michigan   told  The Economist.   The paper is telling us that [...] big data  used in this way  can never give us a better world. In fact  it is likely these systems are making the world worse by accelerating the problems in the world that make things unjust. The good news is there might be ways to address this problem  but it won  t be easy. Many AI researchers are now pursuing technical fixes for machine-learning bias that could create fairer models of online advertising.  A recent paper out of Yale University and the Indian Institute of Technology  for example  suggests that it may be possible to constrain algorithms to minimize discriminatory behavior  albeit at a small cost to ad revenue. But policymakers will need to play a greater role if platforms are to start investing in such fixesâ\\x80\\x94especially if it might affect their bottom line.\\n\\nThis originally appeared in our AI newsletter The Algorithm.

Silicon Valley Apr 5 Google has now cancelled its AI ethics board after a backlash from staff The council lasted  barely more than a week   after thousands of Google employees  signed a petition  calling for the removal of one member. The original plan:  The Advanced Technology External Advisory Council was  set up  to   guide responsible development of AI projects within Google. It had eight members  including technologists  philosophers  and economists  and was meant to hold four meetings a year  starting this month. One of those members  Alessandro Acquisti  a professor at Carnegie Mellon University   had already announced  that he would not be taking up the role. Google says it  s cancelling the whole panel and starting again from scratch   Vox  reports. The trouble:  Concerns centered on the inclusion of Heritage Foundation president Kay Coles James on the panel. Her think tank is skeptical about climate change  and she has personally argued against the protection of LGBTQ rights. Another panel member  drone company CEO Dyan Gibbens  was also controversial given her company provides technology to the military  a sensitive subject  within Google. Google  s statement:  A spokesperson for Google  told Vox :   It  s become clear that in the current environment  ATEAC can  t function as we wanted. So we  re ending the council and going back to the drawing board. We  ll continue to be responsible in our work on the important issues that AI raises  and will find different ways of getting outside opinions on these topics.  That suggests the ethics council will be revived in some form  although it  s unclear if Google will try the same approach next time. But if it does  it  s likely it will be rather more careful around who it appoints.

Getty Images/Leon Neal Almost a thousand Google staff  academic researchers  and other tech industry figures have signed  a letter  protesting the makeup of an independent council that Google created to guide the ethics of its AI projects. The search giant  announced  the creation of the council last week at EmTech Digital  MIT Technology Review  s  event in San Francisco. Known as the Advanced Technology External Advisory Council (ATEAC)  it has eight members including economists  philosophers  policymakers  and technologists with expertise in issues like algorithmic bias. It is meant to hold four meetings a year  starting this month  and write reports designed to provide feedback on projects at the company that use artificial intelligence.\\n\\nBut two of those members proved controversial. One  Dyan Gibbens  is CEO of Trumbull  a company that develops autonomous systems for the defense industryâ\\x80\\x94a contentious choice given that thousands of Google employees protested the companyâ\\x80\\x99s decision to supply the US Air Force with AI for drone imaging. The greatest outrage  though  has come over the inclusion of Kay Coles James  president of the Heritage Foundation  a think tank that opposes regulating carbon emissions  takes a hard line on immigration  and has argued against the protection of LGBTQ rights.\\n\\nOne member of the council  Alessandro Acquisti  a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who specializes in digital privacy issues  announced on March 30th that he wouldn\\'t be taking up the role. â\\x80\\x9cWhile I\\'m devoted to research grappling with key ethical issues of fairness  rights & inclusion in AI  I don\\'t believe this is the right forum for me to engage in this important work \" he tweeted.\\n\\nThe creation of ATEACâ\\x80\\x94and the inclusion of Gibbens and Jamesâ\\x80\\x94may in fact have been designed to appease Googleâ\\x80\\x99s right-wing critics. At roughly the same time the council was announced  Sundar Pichai  Googleâ\\x80\\x99s CEO  was meeting with President Donald Trump. Trump later tweeted: â\\x80\\x9cHe stated strongly that he is totally committed to the U.S. Military  not the Chinese Military. [We] also discussed political fairness and various things that Google can do for our Country. Meeting ended very well!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut one Google employee involved with drafting the protest letter  who spoke on condition of anonymity  said that James is more than just a conservative voice on the council. â\\x80\\x9cShe is a reactionary who denies trans people exist  who endorses radically anti-immigrant positions  and endorses anti-climate-change  anti-science positions.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSome noted AI algorithms can reinforce biases already seen in society; some have been shown to misidentify transgender people  for example. In that context  â\\x80\\x9cthe fact that [James] was included is pretty shocking â\\x80\\x9d the employee said. â\\x80\\x9cThese technologies are shaping our social institutions  our lives  and access to resources. When AI fails  it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t fail for rich white men working at tech companies. It fails for exactly the populations that the Heritage Foundationâ\\x80\\x99s policies are already aiming to harm.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMessages posted to a Google internal communications platform criticized the appointment of James especially. According to one post  earlier reported by the Verge and confirmed by the employee  James â\\x80\\x9cdoesnâ\\x80\\x99t deserve a Google-legitimized platform  and certainly doesnâ\\x80\\x99t belong in any conversation about how Google tech should be applied to the world.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs of 5:30 pm US Eastern time today the public letter  posted to Medium  had been signed by 855 Google employees and 143 other people  including a number of prominent academics. â\\x80\\x9cNot only are Jamesâ\\x80\\x99 views counter to Googleâ\\x80\\x99s stated values â\\x80\\x9d the letter states  â\\x80\\x9cbut they are directly counter to the project of ensuring that the development and application of AI prioritizes justice over profit. Such a project should instead place representatives from vulnerable communities at the center of decision-making.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story said only seven Google employees had signed the letter on Medium.\\n  Artificial Intelligence Mar 29 An AI startup has found a new source of cheap labor for training algorithms: prisoners While the prevailing narrative around AI is that it automates work away  in practice it has really just changed its nature  in many cases creating more menial and more tedious types of jobs. The insatiable need of deep-learning algorithms to train on massive quantities of labeled data  for example  has spawned an entire cottage industry of human labelers. Both the  New York Times  and  GQ China  have covered the emergence of data factories in China  where workers spend hours on end to manually determine the content of images or passages of text for very low wages. Now a startup named Vainu has found a  new source of cheap labor : prison inmates. It has been partnering with two prisons in Finland over the last few months  specifically to improve its Finnish natural-language processing (NLP) capabilities. The cofounder told The Verge that while it uses Amazon Mechanical Turk to crowdsource labor for English NLP training  it initially struggled to find a scalable Finish alternative at the same low cost. The company now pays as much as it would for Mechanical Turk directly to the government agency that oversees the prisons. It  s not known how much actually reaches the prisoners. Vainu has publicized its effort as   a prime example of a company creating work because of AI [... to] employ and empower the new working class. Really  it serves to highlight a growing concern among AI experts and labor activists about how the technology will create even more banal and soul-crushing tasks than those that it is designed to eliminate. Data labeling is just one among many examples  including the work of safety drivers who monotonously sit behind the wheel of self-driving cars and content moderators who mindlessly sift through Facebook posts and YouTube videos to clean up after imprecise algorithms. All these jobs fall into the category of what anthropologist Mary L. Gray and computer scientist Siddharth Suri call    ghost work   a type of labor that fuels the mirage of automation but is devalued because it  s meant to be invisible. In other words  there is indeed a   new working class  but it certainly isn  t being empowered. This story originally appeared in our AI newsletter The Algorithm.

Or what if it knew you were experiencing road rage and would play your favorite song to calm you down? These are some of the questions being asked by Affectiva  a startup spun out of the MIT Media Lab that makes emotion-sensing technology. And the company says it has amassed a significant amount of data on driver behavior through a recent program  capturing everything from road rage to impromptu road-trip singalongs.   [We want] holistic automotive AI systems that not only look outside the vehicle [... but] also look inside the vehicle  said Taniya Mishra  the company  s director of AI research  on stage at EmTech Digital  an event organized by MIT Technology Review.   We want AI to know what is the mental and emotional state of people inside the car. Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No Affectiva is running a program that pays drivers to help train its emotion-recognition system. The company sends drivers a kit including cameras and other sensors to place within their vehicles. These record a person  s facial expressions  gestures  and tone of voice on the road. That data is then labeled by trained specialists for a range of emotions  and fed into deep neural networks. Through this approach  the team has been able to collect a rich source of naturalistic behavior and emotional data. Drivers typically have an initial adjustment period of around one and a half days during which they are self-conscious about being watched  but they quickly get used to it. Taniya Mishra The study has also helped the team deepen their understanding of different patterns in human emotion  such as how anger is typically expressed through both facial expressions and a raised voice while happiness is more often expressed through only facial expressions. Related Story When our devices can read our emotions: Affectiva  s Gabi Zijderveld Emotion-tracking AI is starting to help machines recognize our moods. Are we ready? Emotion-recognition technology is still nascent  but it  could be applied in a variety of ways  beyond automotives. Mishra mentioned  for example  that it could help autistic children like her three-year-old learn to socialize and engage with their peers. It could also help humans engage in more meaningful collaborations with AI   to learn  to find enjoyment  and to do tasks together  she said. But such technology also raises important questions about privacy. Many attendees at EmTech Digital found the idea of having their car monitor their emotions rather   creepy. Mishra also noted that Affectiva made a conscious decision not to use the technology for any kind of security application. How to prevent those uses  however  remains in question as more and more players enter this space. Mishra said it would be important for the tech industry  and society  to engage in open dialogue and discussion. Share Link Tagged Artificial Intelligence    AI Ethics    Machine Learning  Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning A new study shows what it might take to make AI useful in health care Researchers used machine vision to help nurses monitor ICU patients. The way they approached their work shows the value of asking what people actually need artificial intelligence for. by     Karen Hao Mar 23  2019 Hospital intensive care units can be frightening places for patients. And for good reason. In the US  the ICU has a higher mortality rate than any other hospital unit  between 8% and 19%  totaling roughly 500 000 deaths a year. Those who do not die may suffer in other ways  such as long-term physical and mental impairment. For nurses  working in one can easily lead to burnout because it takes so much physical and emotional stamina to administer round-the-clock care. Now a  new paper   published in Nature Digital Medicine  shows how AI might be able to help. It also offers a timely example of how and why AI researchers should work alongside practitioners in other industries.   This study was really pioneering  says Eric Topol  a leading physician and author of the newly released book  Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again . He also serves as co  Ã¬editor in chief of the journal.   They went somewhere where others haven  t been before. The study is the result of a six-year collaboration between AI researchers and medical professionals at Stanford University and Intermountain LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City  Utah. It used machine vision to continuously monitor ICU patients during day-to-day tasks. The goal was to test the feasibility of passively tracking how often they moved and for how long. Early studies of ICU patients have shown that movement can accelerate healing  reduce delirium  and prevent muscle atrophy  but the scope of those studies has been limited by the challenges of monitoring patients at scale.\\n\\nDepth sensors were installed in seven individual patient rooms and collected three-dimensional silhouette data 24 hours a day over the course of two months. The researchers then developed algorithms to analyze the footageâ\\x80\\x94helping them detect when patients climbed into and out of bed or got into and out of a chair  as well as the number of staff involved in each activity.\\n\\nThe results showed preliminary success: on average  the algorithm for detecting mobility activities correctly identified the activities a patient was performing 87% of the time. The algorithm for tracking the number of personnel fared less well  reaching 68% accuracy. The researchers say that both measures would probably be improved by using multiple sensors in each room  to compensate for people blocking one another from a single sensorâ\\x80\\x99s view.\\n\\nRelated Story\\n\\n\\nA little-known AI method can train on your health data without threatening your privacy\\nMachine learning has great potential to transform disease diagnosis and detection  but itâ\\x80\\x99s been held back by patientsâ\\x80\\x99 reluctance to give up access to sensitive information.\\nWhile the results were not as robust as those typically seen in journal publications  the study is one of the first to demonstrate the feasibility of using sensors and algorithms to understand whatâ\\x80\\x99s happening in the ICU. â\\x80\\x9cA lot of people might not have even thought this is possible at all â\\x80\\x9d says Topol. â\\x80\\x9cA patientâ\\x80\\x99s room is kind of like Grand Central Station. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s so many things going on.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe demonstration suggests how these systems might augment the work of hospital staff. If algorithms can track when a patient has fallen or even anticipate when someone is starting to have trouble  they can alert the staff that help is required. This could spare nurses the worry provoked by leaving one patient alone as they go on to care for another.\\n\\nBut what makes the study even more notable is its approach. Much AI research today focuses purely on advancing algorithms out of context  such as by fine-tuning computer vision in a simulated rather than live environment. But when dealing with sensitive applications such as health care  this can lead to algorithms that  while accurate  are unsafe to deploy or do not tackle the right problems.\\n\\nIn contrast  the Stanford team worked with medical professionals from the very beginning to understand what they needed and reframe those needs as machine-vision problems. For example  through discussions with the nurses and other hospital staff  the AI researchers concluded that using depth sensors rather than regular cameras would protect the privacy of patients and personnel. â\\x80\\x9cThe clinicians I worked withâ\\x80\\x94we discussed computer vision and AI for years â\\x80\\x9d says Serena Yeung  one of the lead authors on the paper  who will become an assistant professor of biomedical data science at Stanford this fall. â\\x80\\x9cThrough this process  we were able to unearth new application areas that could benefit from this technology.â\\x80\\x9d \\n\\nThe approach meant the study went slowly: it took time to get buy-in from all levels of the hospital  and it was technically complex to analyze the hectic  messy environment of the ICU while using only silhouette data. But taking this time was absolutely critical to design a safe  effective prototype of a system that will one day be genuinely beneficial to the patients and care staff  says Yeung.\\n\\nUnfortunately  the current culture and incentives in AI research do not lend themselves to such collaborations. The pressure to move fast and publish quickly leads researchers to avoid projects that donâ\\x80\\x99t produce immediate results  and the privatization of a lot of AI funding hurts projects without clear commercialization opportunities. â\\x80\\x9cIt is rare to see people working on an end-to-end system in the real world  and also spending the many years that it takes and doing the grunt work that is required to do this type of impactful work â\\x80\\x9d says Timnit Gebru  co-lead of the Ethical AI Team at Google  who was not involved in the research.\\n\\nFortunately  a growing number of experts are pushing to change the status quo. MIT and Stanford are each opening new interdisciplinary research hubs with a charge to pursue human-centered  ethical AI. Yeung also sees opportunities for algorithmically focused AI conferences like NeurIPS and ICML to partner more closely with researchers who focus on social impact.\\n\\nTopol is optimistic that deeper collaboration between the AI and medical communities will bring forth a new standard of health care. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve never had truly patient-centered care â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cI hope we will get there with this technology.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis story originally appeared in our AI newsletter The Algorithm.

Artificial Intelligence Mar 15 IBM  s photo-scraping scandal shows what a weird bubble AI researchers live in On Tuesday  NBC published a  story  with a gripping headline:   Facial recognition  s   dirty little secret  : Millions of online photos scraped without consent. I  linked  to it in our last Algorithm issue  but it  s worth a revisit today.   The story highlights a recent data set released by IBM with 1 million pictures of faces  intended to help develop fairer face recognition algorithms. (I  wrote  about the news at the time too.) It turns out  NBC found  that those faces were scraped directly from the online photo-hosting site Flickr  without the permission of the subjects or photographers.   For some of you  this practice will immediately feel creepy and weird. For others  it will seem perfectly normal. What this story exposed was not so much a   dirty little secret but  rather  the cultural gulf between the public and the AI community.   Really  for industry insiders  IBM did nothing out of the ordinary. AI researchers hoover up data from various corners of the internet all the time to feed the ever-hungry machine-learning algorithms that require massive amounts of it to train. Instagram photos  for example  are a common source of image data; the hashtags often conveniently correspond to the content of the photos  making it extra easy to generate labeled data. New York Times and Wall Street Journal articles are also a common source of data for well-written  copy-edited sentences. Even better that they are categorized by topic: technology  business  sports.   In fact  scraping data from publicly available sources is so much of an industry standard that it  s taught as a foundational skill (sans ethics) in most data science and machine-learning training. Meanwhile  most tech platforms are designed to invite such scraping by offering APIs with direct access to their data. Until recently  this was done without second thought. (Hello  Facebook.)\\n\\nAll of this isnâ\\x80\\x99t to say that scraping data is right or wrong. There are some totally benign or legitimate ways in which the practice can be used (See â\\x80\\x9cWe analyzed 16 625 papers to figure out where AI is headed nextâ\\x80\\x9d); it really depends on the context. Rather  this story highlights the need for the tech industry to adapt its cultural norms and standard practices to keep pace with the rapid evolution of the technology itself  as well as the publicâ\\x80\\x99s awareness of how their data is used.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere are ways to use our data today that we were not aware of five  10 years ago â\\x80\\x9d says Rumman Chowdhury  the global lead for responsible AI at Accenture Applied Intelligence. â\\x80\\x9cHow could we [the public] possibly have agreed to a capability that did not exist?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIn other words  it may have once been a viable practice to blithely scrape peopleâ\\x80\\x99s data  and it may have once been consent enough for said data to be used as long as it was publicly available  but the advent of AI and the unprecedented scale of Silicon Valleyâ\\x80\\x99s data monopolization and monetization have all changed the equation. Technologists bear the responsibility of changing with it and making sure there is a broad  informed societal consensus for their practices.\\n\\nChowdhuryâ\\x80\\x99s tip to those struggling to navigate the gray areas of data privacy? Think about whether the way youâ\\x80\\x99re using data is in the spirit in which it was originally generated and shared. If you are using it in a completely tangential way  itâ\\x80\\x99s time to pause and reconsider.\\n\\nThis story originally appeared in our AI newsletter The Algorithm.

Walmart/Pixabay/Ms. Tech Artificial Intelligence There  s no such thing as a   tech person in the age of AI We need to stop perpetuating the false dichotomy between technology and the humanities. To do otherwise would be detrimental to society. by     Karen Hao Mar 2  2019 Walmart/Pixabay/Ms. Tech When I was an undergrad at MIT  and later an engineer in Silicon Valley  I always felt like a bit of a black sheep because of my perpetual desire to straddle technology and the humanities. That went against the culture of both worlds  indicative of a broader impulse globally to separate the two.  In hindsight  this separation hasn  t served us so well. As Henry Kissinger  wrote  in the June 2018 issue of the Atlantic:   The Enlightenment started with essentially philosophical insights spread by a new technology. Our period is moving in the opposite direction. It has generated a potentially dominating technology in search of a guiding philosophy. That so-called dominating technology is artificial intelligence. Its sudden rise has already permeated every aspect of our lives  transforming our social  political  and economic systems. We no longer live in a society that reflects our old  manufactured separations. To catch up  we need to restructure the way we learn and work. Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No This was the resounding message at Thursday\\'s celebration for MIT  s new  Schwarzman College of Computing   a $1 billion endeavor to create a central hub of AI research that also cuts across all other disciplines.   The world needs bilinguals  said MIT president Rafael Reif. In other words  the world needs engineers with a better grounding in the liberal arts  who can build more ethical products and platforms  as well as policymakers and civic leaders with a better understanding of technology to help guide responsible innovation. The approach has the potential not just to diversify tech but to help â\\x80\\x9ctechifyâ\\x80\\x9d everything else  said Megan Smith  former CTO for the Obama administration: â\\x80\\x9cWe could really work on ... the hardest problems together in this collaborative way.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFaculty at the new college will work with other MIT departments to cross-pollinate ideas. Classes will also be designed so that technical skills  social sciences  and the humanities are bound up together within each course rather than learned separately.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not just thinking about how you learn computation â\\x80\\x9d Melissa Nobles  the dean of MITâ\\x80\\x99s School of Humanities  Arts  and Social Sciences  told MIT Technology Review after the main-stage event  â\\x80\\x9cbut itâ\\x80\\x99s also students having an awareness of the larger political  social context in which weâ\\x80\\x99re all living.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis has also been my driving mission with MIT Technology Reviewâ\\x80\\x99s AI newsletter  The Algorithm: to dismantle our outdated notions that technology is for the tech people and social problems are for the humanities people; that there is such thing as a â\\x80\\x9cmath person â\\x80\\x9d which is certainly not the same as a â\\x80\\x9cpeople person.â\\x80\\x9d These are false dichotomies  and perpetuating them is proving more and more detrimental.\\n\\nThe cynic in me wonders if a new college can really create enough of a culture shift in research and industry to collapse the distance between these tribal camps.

Artificial Intelligence Mar 1 Self-driving cars may be more likely to hit you if you have dark skin Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology  found  that state-of-the-art object recognition systems are less accurate at detecting pedestrians with darker skin tones. Crash-testing:  The researchers tested eight image-recognition systems (each trained on a standard data set) against a large pool of pedestrian images. They divided the pedestrians into two groups for lighter and darker skin tones according to the  Fitzpatrick skin type scale   a way of classifying human skin color. Color coded:  The detection accuracy of the systems was found to be lower by an average of five percentage points for the group with darker skin. This held true even when controlling for time of day and obstructed view. Under the hood:  Through further analysis  the researchers determined that the bias was probably caused by two things: too few examples of dark-skinned pedetrians and too little emphasis on learning from those examples. They say the bias could be mitigated by adjusting both the data and the algorithm. An earlier version of this story originally appeared in our AI newsletter The Algorithm.

But we had a hard time agreeing: What makes a   bad technology? This story is part of our     March/April 2019     issue See the rest of the issue Subscribe After all  technologies can be bad because they fail to achieve admirable aims  or because they succeed in wicked ones. The most useful technologies can also be the most harmful  think of cars  which are crucial to the modern world yet kill over 1.25 million people a year. And when well-intentioned technologies fail  is it because they are fundamentally flawed or just ahead of their time? Take the  Segway . Inventor Dean Kamen hyped it as a device that would transform cities and transportation. It turned out to be an expensive scooter that makes you look silly. Hoverboards were similarly all the rage until their batteries started exploding. But now (smaller) scooters and (safer) powered skateboards are increasingly popular. If  Google Glass  had been developed by a lesser company  we probably wouldn  t pick on it so much. But Google should have known better. It made the wearer appear elitist and invasive. Then again  like Segways and hoverboards  this was a failed product  not a failed technology; augmented-reality glasses and heads-up displays are finding their public. Some technologies are well-intentioned but solve no real problems and create new ones. Before  electronic voting   automated tabulating of paper ballots left an auditable paper trail. Now elections are more vulnerable to hacking. Some failures apply a technological fix to what is really a social or political problem. Take  One Laptop per Child   which set out to solve inequality in education with a new gadget. But was it simply too early? Commercial laptops  tablets  and  above all  smartphones have since inundated the developing world. Indiscriminate uses of technology worry us. Sometimes this is because regulations are flouted. Gene-editing techniques like CRISPR may one day cure all manner of diseases  but right now we don  t know if CRISPR is safe to use in humans. That  s why the  CRISPR babies  born in 2018 make our list. Other times  it  s because technology has outpaced regulation.  Data trafficking   the sharing and remixing of people  s data without their control or awareness  has contributed to the undermining of personal liberty and democracy itself. Some technologies are just misapplied. So far  cryptocurrency  looks mainly like a way for a handful of speculators to get very rich while a lot of other people end up poorer. But the technology underlying it  blockchain  could yet be transformative in other areas. Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No Still  there are a few inventions we could agree have no redeeming features. Juul and other  e-cigarettes  are addicting a new generation to nicotine  through a loophole that allowed them to escape public health regulations meant to discourage cigarette smoking.  Plastic  coffee pods  save half a minute in the mornings but produce tons of hard-to-recycle waste. And as for selfie sticks â\\x80¦ need we say more?  Silicon Valley Bill Gates explains why we should all be optimists We sat down to talk about breakthrough technologies  China  \\nand reasons to be cheerful with this issue  s guest editor. by     Gideon Lichfield Feb 27  2019 There are a lot of worries today about technology  s harmful effects. How do you retain your famous optimism about it? This story is part of our     March/April 2019     issue See the rest of the issue Subscribe Look at how long people are living  the reduction of under-five mortality  the reduction in how poorly women are treated. Globally  inequity is down: poorer countries are getting richer faster than the richer countries are getting richer. The bulk of humanity lives in middle-income countries today. Fifty years ago  there were very few middle-income countries. Then there  s the ability of science to solve problems. In heart disease and cancer we  ve made a lot of progress; in some of the more chronic diseases like depression and diabetes   Even in obesity  we  re gaining some fundamental understandings of the microbiome and the signaling mechanisms involved. So  yes  I am optimistic. It does bother me that most people aren  t. Maybe you have successful person  s bias? Of course  we have to factor that in. In my own life I  ve been extremely lucky. But even subtracting out my personal experience  I think the big picture is that it  s better to be born today than ever  and it will be better to be born 20 years from now than today. One of the technologies on your list is lab-grown meat  which is still very tentative and expensive. Why did it make the cut? Part of the reason I picked it is to remind people that clean energy does not solve climate change. Only about a quarter of emissions come from electricity generation. This is a category that people werenâ\\x80\\x99t paying much attention to as a greenhouse-gas problem. And yet I think the path to solve it is clearer than in  say  cement or steel or other materials.\\n\\nAnother of your picks is the reinvented toilet  which you call the biggest advance in sanitation in 200 years. Why?\\n\\nBuilding sewers  using clean water  having a processing plantâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s the paradigm in rich countries. In low-income countries  the capital cost of a sewer system is just unattainable. This toilet takes the human waste  liquid and solid  and in most cases does some type of separation. The solids you can essentially burn. The liquids you can filter. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a huge effect on quality of life  in terms of both disgust and disease  in an increasingly urbanized world. The Gates Foundation has given out $200 million in grants to try to get this technology going. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not there yet.\\n\\nThree of your picks are about reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. You lead a $1 billion investment fund  Breakthrough Energy Ventures. But it feels like there are already a lot of technological solutions to climate change. Do we really need more? Isnâ\\x80\\x99t the biggest problem political?\\n\\nNo  the problems are when you say to India  â\\x80\\x9cProvide electricity to everyone to have things we take for grantedâ\\x80\\x94heating  air conditioning.â\\x80\\x9d Their path is to build more coal plants. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the cheapest form of electricity for them. In France they were asked to pay a 5% increase on their diesel price  and even that was unacceptable.\\n\\nThe politics is where you decide how much youâ\\x80\\x99re going to put into basic research or how youâ\\x80\\x99re going to make things attractive for innovative companies. But if we freeze technology today  you will live in a 4 Â°C warmer world in the future  guaranteed.\\n\\nOne of those picks is nuclear fusion. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s something thatâ\\x80\\x99s always seemed just around the corner. What makes you optimistic about it?\\n\\nThe company that Breakthrough put money into  Commonwealth Fusion Systemsâ\\x80\\x94the methods theyâ\\x80\\x99re using allow you to get a dramatic reduction in the size and therefore the capital cost. Itâ\\x80\\x99s very impressive. There are over 10 companies pursuing fusion in different ways. Most of them will not work. But these projects certainly will make a big contribution. So I think itâ\\x80\\x99s important we back fusion.\\n\\nChina is becoming a technology superpower. How do you think that will play out as fear about its power gets entrenched?\\n\\nThe idea that theyâ\\x80\\x99re starting to be innovativeâ\\x80\\x94that is good for the world.\\n\\nLike most middle-_income countries  theyâ\\x80\\x99re more than willing to do big projects. Think of the US in the â\\x80\\x9950s and â\\x80\\x9960s  Japan in the â\\x80\\x9970s and â\\x80\\x9980s  Korea in the â\\x80\\x9980s and â\\x80\\x9990s. Your technological capability gets really strong  and youâ\\x80\\x99re willing to go out and do very  very ambitious things.\\n\\nFor the US  itâ\\x80\\x99s good to have a sense that we have to renew our edge. In the â\\x80\\x9970s and â\\x80\\x9980s  when we were like  â\\x80\\x9cOh jeez  has Japan figured things out we havenâ\\x80\\x99t â\\x80\\x9d we renewed our commitment to basic research. In fact  Japan was never going to overtake us in terms of scientific innovation. But I do think that was healthy for us.\\n\\nThese are edited excerpts from a conversation with Gates at his Seattle office on January 9. You can watch a longer version of the interview here.\\n  Artificial Intelligence Feb 26 Is China  s social credit system as Orwellian as it sounds? In the Western imagination  China  s infamous social credit system is an AI-powered surveillance regime that violates human rights. We often hear about examples of its use for asserting political control  such as last month  when a man was stripped of 950 out of 1 000 points  having been docked 10 points every time he petitioned the government for help with his mother  s medical dispute. But rarely do we hear about the other narrative  in which it is a governance mechanism welcomed by many citizens who are fed up with rampant fraud  counterfeit products  and public health failures. This is the not-so-straightforward reality portrayed by a story from the  South China Morning Post . (Though  to be fair  there are questions about just  how independent the SCMP is .) In the village of Jiakuang Majia within Rongcheng city  one of a dozen places lauded for its success in piloting the program  residents say the scheme has mostly been a positive influence  if an influence at all. There is actually no AI or other technology involved. Rather  points are tracked with paper and manual labor  and many consider the system a peripheral bureaucracy  far from a driving force in their day-to-day lives. China  s social credit system is designed to incentivize lawfulness and integrity. Citizens can earn points for good deeds like volunteering  donating blood  or attracting investments to the city; they can lose them for offenses like breaking traffic rules  evading taxes  or neglecting to care for their elderly parents. Their scores then affect their access to community welfare programs: high scorers receive benefits like free medical checkups and discounts to heating bills; low scorers lose government subsidies or get barred from government jobs. But while this last detail is often characterized in the West as a freedom-infringing power grab by an authoritarian government  many scholars argue that social credit scores won  t have the wide-scale controlling effect presumed. The data the scheme collects doesn  t actually align with the data that  say  a bank needs to determine whether to grant you a loan. Regulations have also been  revised  in instances of intense pushback: Suining County got rid of its point deductions for unauthorized petitions  for example  because of widespread unpopularity. Therefore  these scholars say  the system acts more as a tool of propaganda than a tool of enforcement. Others  point out  that it is simply an extension of Chinese culture  s long tradition of promoting good moral behavior and that Chinese citizens have a completely different perspective on privacy and freedom.

COURTESY OF THE ARTISTS Artificial Intelligence A philosopher argues that an AI can  t be an artist Creativity is  and always will be  a human endeavor. by     Sean Dorrance Kelly Feb 21  2019 Portrait of Edmond Belamy    (2018)  Created with AI algorithms called GANs by Parisian art collective Obvious  sold for $432 500. COURTESY OF THE ARTISTS On March 31  1913  in the Great Hall of the Musikverein concert house in Vienna  a riot broke out in the middle of a performance of an orchestral song by Alban Berg. Chaos descended. Furniture was broken. Police arrested the concert  s organizer for punching Oscar Straus  a little-remembered composer of operettas. Later  at the trial  Straus quipped about the audience  s frustration. The punch  he insisted  was the most harmonious sound of the entire evening. History has rendered a different verdict: the concert  s conductor  Arnold Schoenberg  has gone down as perhaps the most creative and influential composer of the 20th century. You may not enjoy Schoenbergâ\\x80\\x99s dissonant music  which rejects conventional tonality to arrange the 12 notes of the scale according to rules that donâ\\x80\\x99t let any predominate. But he changed what humans understand music to be. This is what makes him a genuinely creative and innovative artist. Schoenbergâ\\x80\\x99s techniques are now integrated seamlessly into everything from film scores and Broadway musicals to the jazz solos of Miles Davis and Ornette Coleman.\\n\\nCreativity is among the most mysterious and impressive achievements of human existence. But what is it?\\n\\nCreativity is not just novelty. A toddler at the piano may hit a novel sequence of notes  but theyâ\\x80\\x99re not  in any meaningful sense  creative. Also  creativity is bounded by history: what counts as creative inspiration in one period or place might be disregarded as ridiculous  stupid  or crazy in another. A community has to accept ideas as good for them to count as creative.\\nAs in Schoenbergâ\\x80\\x99s case  or that of any number of other modern artists  that acceptance need not be universal. It might  indeed  not come for yearsâ\\x80\\x94sometimes creativity is mistakenly dismissed for generations. But unless an innovation is eventually accepted by some community of practice  it makes little sense to speak of it as creative.\\n\\nAdvances in artificial intelligence have led many to speculate that human beings will soon be replaced by machines in every domain  including that of creativity. Ray Kurzweil  a futurist  predicts that by 2029 we will have produced an AI that can pass for an average educated human being. Nick Bostrom  an Oxford philosopher  is more circumspect. He does not give a date but suggests that philosophers and mathematicians defer work on fundamental questions to â\\x80\\x9csuperintelligentâ\\x80\\x9d successors  which he defines as having â\\x80\\x9cintellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBoth believe that once human-level intelligence is produced in machines  there will be a burst of progressâ\\x80\\x94what Kurzweil calls the â\\x80\\x9csingularityâ\\x80\\x9d and Bostrom an â\\x80\\x9cintelligence explosionâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94in which machines will very quickly supersede us by massive measures in every domain. This will occur  they argue  because superhuman achievement is the same as ordinary human achievement except that all the relevant computations are performed much more quickly  in what Bostrom dubs â\\x80\\x9cspeed superintelligence.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSo what about the highest level of human achievementâ\\x80\\x94creative innovation? Are our most creative artists and thinkers about to be massively surpassed by machines?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nHuman creative achievement  because of the way it is socially embedded  will not succumb to advances in artificial intelligence. To say otherwise is to misunderstand both what human beings are and what our creativity amounts to.\\n\\nThis claim is not absolute: it depends on the norms that we allow to govern our culture and our expectations of technology. Human beings have  in the past  attributed great power and genius even to lifeless totems. It is entirely possible that we will come to treat artificially intelligent machines as so vastly superior to us that we will naturally attribute creativity to them. Should that happen  it will not be because machines have outstripped us. It will be because we will have denigrated ourselves.\\n\\nHuman creative achievement  because of the way it is socially embedded  will not succumb to advances in artificial intelligence.\\n\\nAlso  I am primarily talking about machine advances of the sort seen recently with the current deep-_learning paradigm  as well as its computational successors. Other paradigms have governed AI research in the past. These have already failed to realize their promise. Still other paradigms may come in the future  but if we speculate that some notional future AI whose features we cannot meaningfully describe will accomplish wondrous things  that is mythmaking  not reasoned argument about the possibilities of technology.\\n\\nCreative achievement operates differently in different domains. I cannot offer a complete taxonomy of the different kinds of creativity here  so to make the point I will sketch an argument involving three quite different examples: music  games  and mathematics.\\n\\nMusic to my ears\\n\\nCan we imagine a machine of such superhuman creative ability that it brings about changes in what we understand music to be  as Schoenberg did?\\n\\nThatâ\\x80\\x99s what I claim a machine cannot do. Letâ\\x80\\x99s see why.\\n\\nComputer music composition systems have existed for quite some time. In 1965  at the age of 17  Kurzweil himself  using a precursor of the pattern recognition systems that characterize deep-learning algorithms today  programmed a computer to compose recognizable music. Variants of this technique are used today. Deep-learning algorithms have been able to take as input a bunch of Bach chorales  for instance  and compose music so characteristic of Bachâ\\x80\\x99s style that it fools even experts into thinking it is original. This is mimicry. It is what an artist does as an apprentice: copy and perfect the style of others instead of working in an authentic  original voice. It is not the kind of musical creativity that we associate with Bach  never mind with Schoenbergâ\\x80\\x99s radical innovation.\\n\\nSo what do we say? Could there be a machine that  like Schoenberg  invents a whole new way of making music? Of course we can imagine  and even make  such a machine. Given an algorithm that modifies its own compositional rules  we could easily produce a machine that makes music as different from what we now consider good music as Schoenberg did then.\\n\\nBut this is where it gets complicated.\\n\\nWe count Schoenberg as a creative innovator not just because he managed to create a new way of composing music but because people could see in it a vision of what the world should be. Schoenbergâ\\x80\\x99s vision involved the spare  clean  efficient minimalism of modernity. His innovation was not just to find a new algorithm for composing music; it was to find a way of thinking about what music is that allows it to speak to what is needed now.\\n\\nSome might argue that I have raised the bar too high. Am I arguing  they will ask  that a machine needs some mystic  unmeasurable sense of what is socially necessary in order to count as creative? I am notâ\\x80\\x94for two reasons.\\n\\nFirst  remember that in proposing a new  mathematical technique for musical composition  Schoenberg changed our understanding of what music is. It is only creativity of this tradition-defying sort that requires some kind of social sensitivity. Had listeners not experienced his technique as capturing the anti-_traditionalism at the heart of the radical modernity emerging in early-_20th-century Vienna  they might not have heard it as something of aesthetic worth. The point here is that radical creativity is not an â\\x80\\x9cacceleratedâ\\x80\\x9d version of quotidian creativity. Schoenbergâ\\x80\\x99s achievement is not a faster or better version of the type of creativity demonstrated by Oscar Straus or some other average composer: itâ\\x80\\x99s fundamentally different in kind.\\n\\nSecond  my argument is not that the creatorâ\\x80\\x99s responsiveness to social necessity must be conscious for the work to meet the standards of genius. I am arguing instead that we must be able to interpret the work as responding that way. It would be a mistake to interpret a machineâ\\x80\\x99s composition as part of such a vision of the world. The argument for this is simple.\\n\\nClaims like Kurzweilâ\\x80\\x99s that machines can reach human-level intelligence assume that to have a human mind is just to have a human brain that follows some set of computational algorithmsâ\\x80\\x94a view called computationalism. But though algorithms can have moral implications  they are not themselves moral agents. We canâ\\x80\\x99t count the monkey at a typewriter who accidentally types out Othello as a great creative playwright. If there is greatness in the product  it is only an accident. We may be able to see a machineâ\\x80\\x99s product as great  but if we know that the output is merely the result of some arbitrary act or algorithmic formalism  we cannot accept it as the expression of a vision for human good.\\n\\nFor this reason  it seems to me  nothing but another human being can properly be understood as a genuinely creative artist. Perhaps AI will someday proceed beyond its computationalist formalism  but that would require a leap that is unimaginable at the moment. We wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t just be looking for new algorithms or procedures that simulate human activity; we would be looking for new materials that are the basis of being human.\\n\\nA molecule-for-_molecule duplicate of a human being would be human in the relevant way. But we already have a way of producing such a being: it takes about nine months. At the moment  a machine can only do something much less interesting than what a person can do. It can create music in the style of Bach  for instanceâ\\x80\\x94perhaps even music that some experts think is better than Bachâ\\x80\\x99s own. But that is only because its music can be judged against a preexisting standard. What a machine cannot do is bring about changes in our standards for judging the quality of music or of understanding what music is or is not.\\n\\nThis is not to deny that creative artists use whatever tools they have at their disposal  and that those tools shape the sort of art they make. The trumpet helped Davis and Coleman realize their creativity. But the trumpet is not  itself  creative. Artificial-intelligence algorithms are more like musical instruments than they are like people. Taryn Southern  a former American Idol contestant  recently released an album where the percussion  melodies  and chords were algorithmically generated  though she wrote the lyrics and repeatedly tweaked the instrumentation algorithm until it delivered the results she wanted. In the early 1990s  David Bowie did it the other way around: he wrote the music and used a Mac app called Verbalizer to pseudo_randomly recombine sentences into lyrics. Just like previous tools of the music industryâ\\x80\\x94from recording devices to synthesizers to samplers and loopersâ\\x80\\x94new AI tools work by stimulating and channeling the creative abilities of the human artist (and reflect the limitations of those abilities).\\n\\nGames without frontiers\\nMuch has been written about the achievements of deep-learning systems that are now the best Go players in the world. AlphaGo and its variants have strong claims to having created a whole new way of playing the game. They have taught human experts that opening moves long thought to be ill-conceived can lead to victory. The program plays in a style that experts describe as strange and alien. â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re how I imagine games from far in the future â\\x80\\x9d Shi Yue  a top Go player  said of AlphaGoâ\\x80\\x99s play. The algorithm seems to be genuinely creative.\\n\\nIn some important sense it is. Game-playing  though  is different from composing music or writing a novel: in games there is an objective measure of success. We know we have something to learn from AlphaGo because we see it win.\\n\\nBut that is also what makes Go a â\\x80\\x9ctoy domain â\\x80\\x9d a simplified case that says only limited things about the world.\\n\\nThe most fundamental sort of human creativity changes our understanding of ourselves because it changes our understanding of what we count as good. For the game of Go  by contrast  the nature of goodness is simply not up for grabs: a Go strategy is good if and only if it wins. Human life does not generally have this feature: there is no objective measure of success in the highest realms of achievement. Certainly not in art  literature  music  philosophy  or politics. Nor  for that matter  in the development of new technologies.\\n\\nIn various toy domains  machines may be able to teach us about a certain very constrained form of creativity. But the domainâ\\x80\\x99s rules are pre-formed; the system can succeed only because it learns to play well within these constraints. Human culture and human existence are much more interesting than this. There are norms for how human beings act  of course. But creativity in the genuine sense is the ability to change those norms in some important human domain. Success in toy domains is no indication that creativity of this more fundamental sort is achievable.\\n\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s a knockout\\nA skeptic might contend that the argument works only because Iâ\\x80\\x99m contrasting games with artistic genius. There are other paradigms of creativity in the scientific and mathematical realm. In these realms  the question isnâ\\x80\\x99t about a vision of the world. It is about the way things actually are.\\n\\nMight a machine come up with mathematical proofs so far beyond us that we simply have to defer to its creative genius?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nComputer_s have already assisted with notable mathematical achievements. But their contributions havenâ\\x80\\x99t been particularly creative. Take the first major theorem proved using a computer: the four-color theorem  which states that any flat map can be colored with at most four colors in such a way that no two adjacent â\\x80\\x9ccountriesâ\\x80\\x9d end up with the same one (it also applies to countries on the surface of a globe).\\n\\nNearly a half-century ago  in 1976  Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken at the University of Illinois published a computer-_assisted proof of this theorem. The computer performed billions of calculations  checking thousands of different types of mapsâ\\x80\\x94so many that it was (and remains) logistically unfeasible for humans to verify that each possibility accorded with the computerâ\\x80\\x99s view. Since then  computers have assisted in a wide range of new proofs.\\n\\nElectric Fan (2018)\\nTom White uses â\\x80\\x9cperception engines â\\x80\\x9d algorithms that distill the data collected from thousands of photographs of common objects  to synthesize abstract shapes. He then tests and refines the results until they are recognizable by the system.\\nELECTRIC FAN  COURTESY OF TOM WHITE  MAS â\\x80\\x9998  DRIB.NET\\nBut the supercomputer is not doing anything creative by checking a huge number of cases. Instead  it is doing something boring a huge number of times. This seems like almost the opposite of creativity. Furthermore  it is so far from the kind of understanding we normally think a mathematical proof should offer that some experts donâ\\x80\\x99t consider these computer_-assisted strategies mathematical proofs at all. As Thomas Tymoczko  a philosopher of mathematics  has argued  if we canâ\\x80\\x99t even verify whether the proof is correct  then all we are really doing is trusting in a potentially error-prone computational process.\\n\\nEven supposing we do trust the results  however  computer-assisted proofs are something like the analogue of computer-assisted composition. If they give us a worthwhile product  it is mostly because of the contribution of the human being. But some experts have argued that artificial intelligence will be able to achieve more than this. Let us suppose  then  that we have the ultimate: a self-reliant machine that proves new theorems all on its own.\\n\\nCould a machine like this massively surpass us in mathematical creativity  as Kurzweil and Bostrom argue? Suppose  for instance  that an AI comes up with a resolution to some extremely important and difficult open problem in mathematics.\\n\\nThe capacity for genuine creativity  the kind of creativity that updates our understanding of the nature of being  is at the ground of what it is to be human.\\n\\nThere are two possibilities. The first is that the proof is extremely clever  and when experts in the field go over it they discover that it is correct. In this case  the AI that discovered the proof would be applauded. The machine itself might even be considered to be a creative mathematician. But such a machine would not be evidence of the singularity; it would not so outstrip us in creativity that we couldnâ\\x80\\x99t even understand what it was doing. Even if it had this kind of human-level creativity  it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t lead inevitably to the realm of the superhuman.\\n\\nSome mathematicians are like musical virtuosos: they are distinguished by their fluency in an existing idiom. But geniuses like Srinivasa Ramanujan  Emmy Noether  and Alexander Grothendieck arguably reshaped mathematics just as Schoenberg reshaped music. Their achievements were not simply proofs of long-standing hypotheses but new and unexpected forms of reasoning  which took hold not only on the strength of their logic but also on their ability to convince other mathematicians of the significance of their innovations. A notional AI that comes up with a clever proof to a problem that has long befuddled human mathematicians is akin to AlphaGo and its variants: impressive  but nothing like Schoenberg.\\n\\nThat brings us to the other option. Suppose the best and brightest deep-learning algorithm is set loose and after some time says  â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve found a proof of a fundamentally new theorem  but itâ\\x80\\x99s too complicated for even your best mathematicians to understand.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis isnâ\\x80\\x99t actually possible. A proof that not even the best mathematicians can understand doesnâ\\x80\\x99t really count as a proof. Proving something implies that you are proving it to someone. Just as a musician has to persuade her audience to accept her aesthetic concept of what is good music  a mathematician has to persuade other mathematicians that there are good reasons to believe her vision of the truth. To count as a valid proof in mathematics  a claim must be understandable and endorsable by some independent set of experts who are in a good position to understand it. If the experts who should be able to understand the proof canâ\\x80\\x99t  then the community refuses to endorse it as a proof.\\n\\nFor this reason  mathematics is more like music than one might have thought. A machine could not surpass us massively in creativity because either its achievement would be understandable  in which case it would not massively surpass us  or it would not be understandable  in which case we could not count it as making any creative advance at all.\\n\\nThe eye of the beholder\\nEngineering and applied science are  in a way  somewhere between these examples. There is something like an objective  external measure of success. You canâ\\x80\\x99t â\\x80\\x9cwinâ\\x80\\x9d at bridge building or medicine the way you can at chess  but one can see whether the bridge falls down or the virus is eliminated. These objective criteria come into play only once the domain is fairly well specified: coming up with strong  lightweight materials  say  or drugs that combat particular diseases. An AI might help in drug discovery by  in effect  doing the same thing as the AI that composed what sounded like a well-executed Bach cantata or came up with a brilliant Go strategy. Like a microscope  telescope  or calculator  such an AI is properly understood as a tool that enables human discoveryâ\\x80\\x94not as an autonomous creative agent.\\n\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s worth thinking about the theory of special relativity here. Albert Einstein is remembered as the â\\x80\\x9cdiscovererâ\\x80\\x9d of relativityâ\\x80\\x94but not because he was the first to come up with equations that better describe the structure of space and time. George Fitzgerald  Hendrik Lorentz  and Henri PoincarÃ©  among others  had written down those equations before Einstein. He is acclaimed as the theoryâ\\x80\\x99s discoverer because he had an original  remarkable  and true understanding of what the equations meant and could convey that understanding to others.\\n\\nFor a machine to do physics that is in any sense comparable to Einsteinâ\\x80\\x99s in creativity  it must be able to persuade other physicists of the worth of its ideas at least as well as he did. Which is to say  we would have to be able to accept its proposals as aiming to communicate their own validity to us. Should such a machine ever come into being  as in the parable of Pinocchio  we would have to treat it as we would a human being. That means  among other things  we would have to attribute to it not only intelligence but whatever dignity and moral worth is appropriate to human beings as well. We are a long way off from this scenario  it seems to me  and there is no reason to think the current computationalist paradigm of artificial intelligenceâ\\x80\\x94in its deep-learning form or any otherâ\\x80\\x94will ever move us closer to it.\\n\\nCreativity is one of the defining features of human beings. The capacity for genuine creativity  the kind of creativity that updates our understanding of the nature of being  that changes the way we understand what it is to be beautiful or good or trueâ\\x80\\x94that capacity is at the ground of what it is to be human. But this kind of creativity depends upon our valuing it  and caring for it  as such. As the writer Brian Christian has pointed out  human beings are starting to act less like beings who value creativity as one of our highest possibilities  and more like machines themselves.\\n\\nHow many people today have jobs that require them to follow a predetermined script for their conversations? How little of what we know as real  authentic  creative  and open-ended human conversation is left in this eviscerated charade? How much is it like  instead  the kind of rule-following that a machine can do? And how many of us  insofar as we allow ourselves to be drawn into these kinds of scripted performances  are eviscerated as well? How much of our day do we allow to be filled with effectively machine-like activitiesâ\\x80\\x94filling out computerized forms and questionnaires  responding to click-bait that works on our basest  most animal-like impulses  playing games that are designed to optimize our addictive response?\\n\\nWe are in danger of this confusion in some of the deepest domains of human achievement as well. If we allow ourselves to say that machine proofs we cannot understand are genuine â\\x80\\x9cproofs â\\x80\\x9d for example  ceding social authority to machines  we will be treating the achievements of mathematics as if they required no human understanding at all. We will be taking one of our highest forms of creativity and intelligence and reducing it to a single bit of information: yes or no.\\n\\nThe Butcherâ\\x80\\x99s Son (2018)\\nMario Klingemann used two GANs  one trained on a data set of human poses and one trained on pornography  to render thousands of composite images. After evaluating each for pose and detail  he chose one to refine into the finished work.\\nCOURTESY OF THE ARTIST\\nEven if we had that information  it would be of little value to us without some understanding of the reasons underlying it. We must not lose sight of the essential character of reasoning  which is at the foundation of what mathematics is.\\n\\nSo too with art and music and philosophy and literature. If we allow ourselves to slip in this way  to treat machine â\\x80\\x9ccreativityâ\\x80\\x9d as a substitute for our own  then machines will indeed come to seem incomprehensibly superior to us. But that is because we will have lost track of the fundamental role that creativity plays in being human.\\n\\nSean Dorrance Kelly is a philosophy professor at Harvard and coauthor of the New York Times best-selling book All Things Shining.  Ms. Tech; Photo: PIXOLOGICSTUDIO/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics This is how AI bias really happens  and why it  s so hard to fix Bias can creep in at many stages of the deep-learning process  and the standard practices in computer science aren  t designed to detect it. by     Karen Hao Feb 4  2019 Ms. Tech; Photo: PIXOLOGICSTUDIO/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Over the past few months  we  ve documented how the  vast majority  of AI  s applications today are based on the category of algorithms known as deep learning  and how  deep-learning algorithms  find patterns in data. We  ve also covered how these technologies affect people  s lives: how they can perpetuate injustice in  hiring  retail  and security  and may already be doing so in the  criminal legal system . But it  s not enough just to know that this bias exists. If we want to be able to fix it  we need to understand the mechanics of how it arises in the first place. How AI bias happens We often shorthand our explanation of AI bias by blaming it on biased training data. The reality is more nuanced: bias can creep in  long before the data  is collected as well as at  many other stages  of the deep-learning process. For the purposes of this discussion  we  ll focus on three key stages. Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No Framing the problem.  The first thing computer scientists do when they create a deep-learning model is decide what they actually want it to achieve. A credit card company  for example  might want to predict a customer  s creditworthiness  but   creditworthiness is a rather nebulous concept. In order to translate it into something that can be computed  the company must decide whether it wants to  say  maximize its profit margins or maximize the number of loans that get repaid. It could then define creditworthiness within the context of that goal. The problem is that   those decisions are made for various business reasons other than fairness or discrimination  explains Solon Barocas  an assistant professor at Cornell University who specializes in fairness in machine learning. If the algorithm discovered that giving out subprime loans was an effective way to maximize profit  it would end up engaging in predatory behavior even if that wasn  t the company  s intention. Collecting the data.  There are two main ways that bias shows up in training data: either the data you collect is unrepresentative of reality  or it reflects existing prejudices. The first case might occur  for example  if a deep-learning algorithm is fed more photos of light-skinned faces than dark-skinned faces. The resulting face recognition system would inevitably be  worse  at recognizing darker-skinned faces. The second case is precisely what happened when Amazon discovered that its internal recruiting tool was  dismissing female candidates . Because it was trained on historical hiring decisions  which favored men over women  it learned to do the same. Preparing the data.  Finally  it is possible to introduce bias during the data preparation stage  which involves selecting which attributes you want the algorithm to consider. (This is not to be confused with the problem-framing stage. You can use the same attributes to train a model for very different goals or use very different attributes to train a model for the same goal.) In the case of modeling creditworthiness  an   attribute could be the customer  s age  income  or number of paid-off loans. In the case of Amazon  s recruiting tool  an   attribute could be the candidate  s gender  education level  or years of experience. This is what people often call the   art of deep learning: choosing which attributes to consider or ignore can significantly influence your model  s prediction accuracy. But while its impact on accuracy is easy to measure  its impact on the model  s bias is not. Why AI bias is hard to fix Given that context  some of the challenges of mitigating bias may already be apparent to you. Here we highlight four main ones. Unknown unknowns.  The introduction of bias isn  t always obvious during a model  s construction because you may not realize the downstream impacts of your data and choices until much later. Once you do  it  s hard to retroactively identify where that bias came from and then figure out how to get rid of it. In Amazon  s case  when the engineers initially discovered that its tool was penalizing female candidates  they reprogrammed it to ignore explicitly gendered words like   women  s. They soon discovered that the revised system was still picking up on  implicitly  gendered words   verbs that were highly correlated with men over women  such as   executed and   captured  and using that to make its decisions. Imperfect processes.  First  many of the standard practices in deep learning are not designed with bias detection in mind. Deep-learning models are tested for performance before they are deployed  creating what would seem to be a perfect opportunity for catching bias. But in practice  testing usually looks like this: computer scientists randomly split their data  before  training into one group that  s actually used for training and another that  s reserved for validation once training is done. That means the data you use to test the performance of your model has the same biases as the data you used to train it. Thus  it will fail to flag skewed or prejudiced results.Lack of social context. Similarly  the way in which computer scientists are taught to frame problems often isnâ\\x80\\x99t compatible with the best way to think about social problems. For example  in a new paper  Andrew Selbst  a postdoc at the Data & Society Research Institute  identifies what he calls the â\\x80\\x9cportability trap.â\\x80\\x9d Within computer science  it is considered good practice to design a system that can be used for different tasks in different contexts. â\\x80\\x9cBut what that does is ignore a lot of social context â\\x80\\x9d says Selbst. â\\x80\\x9cYou canâ\\x80\\x99t have a system designed in Utah and then applied in Kentucky directly because different communities have different versions of fairness. Or you canâ\\x80\\x99t have a system that you apply for â\\x80\\x98fairâ\\x80\\x99 criminal justice results then applied to employment. How we think about fairness in those contexts is just totally different.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe definitions of fairness. Itâ\\x80\\x99s also not clear what the absence of bias should look like. This isnâ\\x80\\x99t true just in computer scienceâ\\x80\\x94this question has a long history of debate in philosophy  social science  and law. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s different about computer science is that the concept of fairness has to be defined in mathematical terms  like balancing the false positive and false negative rates of a prediction system. But as researchers have discovered  there are many different mathematical definitions of fairness that are also mutually exclusive. Does fairness mean  for example  that the same proportion of black and white individuals should get high risk assessment scores? Or that the same level of risk should result in the same score regardless of race? Itâ\\x80\\x99s impossible to fulfill both definitions at the same time (hereâ\\x80\\x99s a more in-depth look at why)  so at some point you have to pick one. But whereas in other fields this decision is understood to be something that can change over time  the computer science field has a notion that it should be fixed. â\\x80\\x9cBy fixing the answer  youâ\\x80\\x99re solving a problem that looks very different than how society tends to think about these issues â\\x80\\x9d says Selbst.\\n\\nWhere we go from here\\n\\nIf youâ\\x80\\x99re reeling from our whirlwind tour of the full scope of the AI bias problem  so am I. But fortunately a strong contingent of AI researchers are working hard to address the problem. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve taken a variety of approaches: algorithms that help detect and mitigate hidden biases within training data or that mitigate the biases learned by the model regardless of the data quality; processes that hold companies accountable to the fairer outcomes and discussions that hash out the different definitions of fairness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Fixingâ\\x80\\x99 discrimination in algorithmic systems is not something that can be solved easily â\\x80\\x9d says Selbst. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a process ongoing  just like discrimination in any other aspect of society.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis originally appeared in our AI newsletter The Algorithm.

Busâ\\x88\\x9aâ\\x80\\xa0 Photography/Getty Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics Making face recognition less biased doesn  t make it less scary Three new studies propose ways to make algorithms better at identifying people in different demographic groups. But without regulation  that won  t curb the technology  s potential for abuse. by     Karen Hao\\nJan 29  2019\\nIn the past few years  thereâ\\x80\\x99s been a dramatic rise in the adoption of face recognition  detection  and analysis technology.\\n\\nYouâ\\x80\\x99re probably most familiar with recognition systems  like Facebookâ\\x80\\x99s photo-tagging recommender and Appleâ\\x80\\x99s FaceID  which can identify specific individuals. Detection systems  on the other hand  determine whether a face is present at all; and analysis systems try to identify aspects like gender and race. All of these systems are now being used for a variety of purposes  from hiring and retail to security and surveillance.\\n\\nMany people believe that such systems are both highly accurate and impartial. The logic goes that airport security staff can get tired and police can misjudge suspects  but a well-trained AI system should be able to consistently identify or categorize any image of a face.\\n\\nBut in practice  research has repeatedly shown that these systems deal with some demographic groups much more inaccurately than others. Last year  Gender Shades  a seminal study led by MIT Media Lab researcher Joy Buolamwini  found that gender classification systems sold by IBM  Microsoft  and Face++ had an error rate as much as 34.4 percentage points higher for darker-skinned females than lighter-skinned males. The ACLU of Northern California similarly found that Amazonâ\\x80\\x99s platform was more likely to misidentify non-white than white members of Congress.\\nThe problem is that face recognition and analysis systems are often trained on skewed data sets: theyâ\\x80\\x99re fed far fewer images of women and people with dark skin than they are images of men and people with light skin. And while many of them are supposedly tested for fairness  those tests donâ\\x80\\x99t check performance on a wide enough range of facesâ\\x80\\x94as Buolamwini found. These disparities perpetuate and further entrench existing injustices and lead to consequences that only worsen as the stakes get higher.\\n\\nThree new papers released in the past week are now bringing much-needed attention to this issue. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s a brief description of each of them.\\n\\nPaper #1. Last Thursday  Buolamwini released an update to Gender Shades by retesting the systems sheâ\\x80\\x99d previously examined and expanding her review to include Amazonâ\\x80\\x99s Rekognition and a new system from a small AI company called Kairos. There is some good news. She found that IBM  Face++  and Microsoft all improved their gender classification accuracy for darker-skinned women  with Microsoft reducing its error rate to below 2%. On the other hand  Amazonâ\\x80\\x99s and Kairosâ\\x80\\x99s platforms still had accuracy gaps of 31 and 23 percentage points  respectively  between lighter males and darker females. Buolamwini said the study shows that these technologies must be externally audited to hold them technically accountable.\\n\\n\\nPaper #2. On Sunday  a study from the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) demonstrated the effectiveness of a new algorithm for mitigating biases in a face detection system even when itâ\\x80\\x99s trained on heavily biased data. As it trains  it also identifies which examples in the data are underrepresented and spends extra time looking at them to compensate. When the researchers tested the system against Buolamwiniâ\\x80\\x99s Gender Shades data set  they found that it helped close their own largest accuracy gap  between lighter- and darker-skinned males  compared with a standard training algorithm (though it didnâ\\x80\\x99t eliminate it completely).\\n\\nPaper #3. This morning  IBM Research released a paper that identifies dozens of features for measuring diversity beyond skin color and gender  including head height  face width  intra-eye distance  and age. The findings are based on previous research on human faces. â\\x80\\x9cUnless we have measures of facial diversity â\\x80\\x9d says John Smith  one of the coauthors of the paper  â\\x80\\x9cwe canâ\\x80\\x99t come back and enforce them as we train these face recognition systems.â\\x80\\x9d In conjunction  the team released a new data set with 1 million images of faces  annotated with these new measures.\\n\\n\\nEach of these studies has taken important steps toward addressing bias in facial recognitionâ\\x80\\x94by holding companies accountable  by creating new algorithms  and by expanding our understanding of data diversity. But creating fairer and more accurate systems is only half the battle.\\n\\nEven the fairest and most accurate systems can still be used to infringe on peopleâ\\x80\\x99s civil liberties. Last year  a Daily Beast investigation found that Amazon was actively pitching its facial surveillance platform to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement  better known as ICE  to aid its crackdown on migrant communities. An Intercept investigation also found that IBM developed the ability to identify the ethnicity of faces as part of a long-term partnership with the New York Police Department. This technology was then deployed in public surveillance cameras for testing  without the knowledge of city residents. Already  the UK Metropolitan Police use facial recognition to scan public crowds for people on watch lists  and China uses it for mass surveillance of all residents  for purposes including tracking dissidents.\\n\\nIn response to the rapid proliferation of these systems  a growing number of civil rights activists and technologists have called for them to be regulated; Google has even suspended its sale of such systems until it has clear strategies for preventing their abuse.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWithout algorithmic justice  algorithmic accuracy/technical fairness can create AI tools that are weaponized â\\x80\\x9d says Buolamwini.\\n\\nThis story originally appeared in our AI newsletter The Algorithm.

Ian Waldie/Getty Images Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics AI is sending people to jail  and getting it wrong Using historical data to train risk assessment tools could mean that machines are copying the mistakes of the past. by     Karen Hao Jan 21  2019 Ian Waldie/Getty Images AI might not seem to have a huge personal impact if your most frequent brush with machine-learning algorithms is through Facebook  s news feed or Google  s search rankings. But at the  Data for Black Lives  conference last weekend  technologists  legal experts  and community activists snapped things into perspective with a discussion of America  s criminal justice system. There  an algorithm can determine the trajectory of your life. The US imprisons more people than any other country in the world. At the end of 2016  nearly  2.2 million adults  were being held in prisons or jails  and an additional 4.5 million were in other correctional facilities. Put another way  1 in 38 adult Americans was under some form of correctional supervision. The nightmarishness of this situation is one of the few issues that unite politicians on both sides of the aisle. Under immense pressure to reduce prison numbers without risking a rise in crime  courtrooms across the US have turned to automated tools in attempts to shuffle defendants through the legal system as efficiently and safely as possible. This is where the AI part of our story begins. Sign up for     The Algorithm   Police departments use predictive algorithms to strategize about where to send their ranks. Law enforcement agencies use face recognition systems to help identify suspects. These practices have garnered well-deserved scrutiny for whether they in fact improve safety or simply perpetuate existing inequities. Researchers and civil rights advocates  for example  have repeatedly demonstrated that face recognition systems can fail spectacularly  particularly for dark-skinned individualsâ\\x80\\x94even mistaking members of Congress for convicted criminals.\\n\\nBut the most controversial tool by far comes after police have made an arrest. Say hello to criminal risk assessment algorithms.\\n\\nRisk assessment tools are designed to do one thing: take in the details of a defendantâ\\x80\\x99s profile and spit out a recidivism scoreâ\\x80\\x94a single number estimating the likelihood that he or she will reoffend. A judge then factors that score into a myriad of decisions that can determine what type of rehabilitation services particular defendants should receive  whether they should be held in jail before trial  and how severe their sentences should be. A low score paves the way for a kinder fate. A high score does precisely the opposite.\\n\\n\\nThe logic for using such algorithmic tools is that if you can accurately predict criminal behavior  you can allocate resources accordingly  whether for rehabilitation or for prison sentences. In theory  it also reduces any bias influencing the process  because judges are making decisions on the basis of data-driven recommendations and not their gut.\\n\\nYou may have already spotted the problem. Modern-day risk assessment tools are often driven by algorithms trained on historical crime data.\\n\\nAs weâ\\x80\\x99ve covered before  machine-learning algorithms use statistics to find patterns in data. So if you feed it historical crime data  it will pick out the patterns associated with crime. But those patterns are statistical correlationsâ\\x80\\x94nowhere near the same as causations. If an algorithm found  for example  that low income was correlated with high recidivism  it would leave you none the wiser about whether low income actually caused crime. But this is precisely what risk assessment tools do: they turn correlative insights into causal scoring mechanisms.\\n\\nNow populations that have historically been disproportionately targeted by law enforcementâ\\x80\\x94especially low-income and minority communitiesâ\\x80\\x94are at risk of being slapped with high recidivism scores. As a result  the algorithm could amplify and perpetuate embedded biases and generate even more bias-tainted data to feed a vicious cycle. Because most risk assessment algorithms are proprietary  itâ\\x80\\x99s also impossible to interrogate their decisions or hold them accountable.\\n\\nThe debate over these tools is still raging on. Last July  more than 100 civil rights and community-based organizations  including the ACLU and the NAACP  signed a statement urging against the use of risk assessment. At the same time  more and more jurisdictions and states  including California  have turned to them in a hail-Mary effort to fix their overburdened jails and prisons.\\n\\nData-driven risk assessment is a way to sanitize and legitimize oppressive systems  Marbre Stahly-Butts  executive director of Law for Black Lives  said onstage at the conference  which was hosted at the MIT Media Lab. It is a way to draw attention away from the actual problems affecting low-income and minority communities  like defunded schools and inadequate access to health care.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe are not risks â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cWe are needs.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis story originally appeared in our AI newsletter The Algorithm.

Perhaps the best example of this is a high-tech take on the ethical dilemma known as the trolley problem: if a self-driving car cannot stop itself from killing one of two pedestrians  how should the car  s control software choose  who live and who dies ? In reality  this conundrum isn  t a very realistic depiction of how self-driving cars behave. But many other systems that are already here or not far off will have to make all sorts of real ethical trade-offs. Assessment tools currently used in the criminal justice system must consider risks to society against harms to individual defendants; autonomous weapons will need to weigh the lives of soldiers against those of civilians. The problem is  algorithms were never designed to handle such tough choices. They are built to pursue a single mathematical goal  such as maximizing the number of soldiers   lives saved or minimizing the number of civilian deaths. When you start dealing with multiple  often competing  objectives or try to account for intangibles like   freedom and   well-being  a satisfactory mathematical solution doesn  t always exist. Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No   We as humans want multiple incompatible things  says Peter Eckersley  the director of research for the Partnership on AI  who recently released a  paper  that explores this issue.   There are many high-stakes situations where it  s actually inappropriate  perhaps dangerous  to program in a single objective function that tries to describe your ethics. These solutionless dilemmas aren  t specific to algorithms. Ethicists have studied them for decades and refer to them as impossibility theorems. So when Eckersley first recognized their applications to artificial intelligence  he borrowed an idea directly from the field of ethics to propose a solution: what if we built uncertainty into our algorithms?   We make decisions as human beings in quite uncertain ways a lot of the time  he says.   Our behavior as moral beings is full of uncertainty. But when we try to take that ethical behavior and apply it in AI  it tends to get concretized and made more precise. Instead  Eckersley proposes  why not explicitly design our algorithms to be uncertain about the right thing to do? Eckersley puts forth two possible techniques to express this idea mathematically. He begins with the premise that algorithms are typically programmed with clear rules about human preferences. We  d have to tell it  for example  that we definitely prefer friendly soldiers over friendly civilians  and friendly civilians over enemy soldiers  even if we weren  t actually sure or didn  t think that should always be the case. The algorithm  s design leaves little room for uncertainty. The first technique  known as partial ordering  begins to introduce just the slightest bit of uncertainty. You could program the algorithm to prefer friendly soldiers over enemy soldiers and friendly civilians over enemy soldiers  but you wouldn  t specify a preference between friendly soldiers and friendly civilians. In the second technique  known as uncertain ordering  you have several lists of absolute preferences  but each one has a probability attached to it. Three-quarters of the time you might prefer friendly soldiers over friendly civilians over enemy soldiers. A quarter of the time you might prefer friendly civilians over friendly soldiers over enemy soldiers. The algorithm could handle this uncertainty by computing multiple solutions and then giving humans a menu of options with their associated trade-offs  Eckersley says. Say the AI system was meant to help make medical decisions. Instead of recommending one treatment over another  it could present three possible options: one for maximizing patient life span  another for minimizing patient suffering  and a third for minimizing cost.   Have the system be explicitly unsure  he says    and hand the dilemma back to the humans. Carla Gomes  a professor of computer science at Cornell University  has experimented with similar techniques in her work. In one project  she  s been developing an automated system to evaluate the impact of new hydroelectric dam projects in the Amazon River basin. The dams provide a source of clean energy. But they also profoundly alter sections of river and disrupt wildlife ecosystems.   This is a completely different scenario from autonomous cars or other [commonly referenced ethical dilemmas]  but it  s another setting where these problems are real  she says.   There are two conflicting objectives  so what should you do?   The overall problem is very complex  she adds.   It will take a body of research to address all issues  but Peter  s approach is making an important step in the right direction. It  s an issue that will only grow with our reliance on algorithmic systems.   More and more  complicated systems require AI to be in charge  says Roman V. Yampolskiy  an associate professor of computer science at the University of Louisville.   No single person can understand the complexity of  you know  the whole stock market or military response systems. So we  ll have no choice but to give up some of our control to machines.

Share Link Tagged  Emil Bruckner/Unsplash Artificial Intelligence Americans want to regulate AI but don  t trust anyone to do it The public thinks that human-level AI is likely to cause more harm than good  a new report has shown. by     Karen Hao Jan 10  2019 Emil Bruckner/Unsplash In 2018   several high-profile controversies  involving AI served as a wake-up call for technologists  policymakers  and the public. The technology may have brought us welcome advances in many fields  but it can also fail catastrophically when built shoddily or applied carelessly. It  s hardly a surprise  then  that Americans have mixed support for the continued development of AI and overwhelmingly agree that it should be regulated  according to a  new study  from the Center for the Governance of AI and Oxford University  s Future of Humanity Institute. Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No These are important lessons for policymakers and technologists to consider in the discussion on how best to advance and regulate AI  says Allan Dafoe  director of the center and coauthor of the report.   There isn  t currently a consensus in favor of developing advanced AI  or that it  s going to be good for humanity  he says.   That kind of perception could lead to the development of AI being perceived as illegitimate or cause political backlashes against the development of AI. It  s clear that decision makers in the US and around the world need to have a better understanding of the public  s concerns  and how they should be addressed. Here are some of the key takeaways from the report. Americans aren  t sure AI is a good thing While more Americans support than oppose AI development  there isn  t a strong consensus either way.A higher percentage of respondents also believe high-level machine intelligence would do more harm than good for humanity. When asked to rank their specific concerns  they listed a weakening of data privacy and the increased sophistication of cyber-attacks at the top  both as issues of high importance and as those highly likely to affect many Americans within the next 10 years. Autonomous weapons closely followed in importance but were ranked with a lower likelihood of wide-scale impact.  Americans want better AI governance More than 8 in 10 Americans believe that AI and robotics should be managed carefully. i That is easier said than done because they also don  t trust any one entity to pick up that mantle. Among the different options presented from among federal and international agencies  companies  nonprofits  and universities  none received more than 50% of the respondents   trust to develop and manage AI responsibly. The US military and university researchers did  however  receive the most trust for developing the technology  while tech companies and nonprofits received more trust than government actors for regulating it.I believe AI could be a tremendous benefit  Dafoe says. But the report shows a main obstacle in the way of getting there:   You have to make sure that you have a broad legitimate consensus around what society is going to undertake. Correction:  An earlier version of this story had a typo in the first chart  showing that 31% of Americans \"somewhat oppose\" AI development. It has been corrected to 13%.

Can an algorithm stop them? by     Chen Qiufan  translated by Emily Jin and Ken Liu Dec 16  2018 George Wylesol Though only 23 minutes on the high-speed rail from Shenzhen North to West Kowloon  the journey from the mainland to Hong Kong seems to transport me back half a century. The concrete jungle of my childhood memories hasn  t changed one bit. Time seems trapped in the amber of this city of seven million  while the Shenzhen Bay area that I departed has already arrived at the future ahead of schedule. This story is part of our     January/February 2019     issue See the rest of the issue Subscribe My classmate from a decade earlier  Dr. Ng Lok Tin of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology  waits for me at the station exit. As though to highlight the discombobulation of modern China  he greets me in Cantonese though heâ\\x80\\x99s a native of Shanghai; I  Hong Kong born  on the other hand  speak to him in Modern Standard Mandarin.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLeung Wah Kiu  whatâ\\x80\\x99s this really about?â\\x80\\x9d he asks me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA few days ago  two plainclothes officers approached me to ask if Professor Lau had been in touch and for the contact info of his relatives and friends in Hong Kong.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought he had been placed in compulsory treatment some time ago?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRight  in a special care center in Shenzhen. But he broke out and escaped to Hong Kong  and theyâ\\x80\\x99ve lost his trail. We have to find him before the police do.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d Ng Lok Tin examines my face carefully  as if evaluating my sanity. Then realization dawns. â\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t believe heâ\\x80\\x99s gone mad at all  do you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wonâ\\x80\\x99t know until I see him in person.â\\x80\\x9d I canâ\\x80\\x99t keep the uncertainty out of my voice. â\\x80\\x9cHelp me  please.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nProfessor Lau Gim Wai  a leading expert in neurobehavioral imaging  had mentored us both in school. However  to me  heâ\\x80\\x99s much more than just a teacher.\\n\\nMore than a decade ago  when I was breaking under the stress of my PhD thesis and despondent from estrangement with my family  Professor Lau sent me e-mails daily  quoting lines from his favorite movies in his signature. Although he never said so explicitly  I knew that those linesâ\\x80\\x94warm  encouraging  and upliftingâ\\x80\\x94were meant for me.\\n\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve never even seen some of those movies  but I remember every single quote he sent.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you wake up at a different time  in a different place  could you wake up as a different person?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94Fight Club (1999)\\n\\nWhen I became a different person on that rainy night  he was the one who saved me.\\n\\nI must find out what has gone wrong with Professor Lau and his DISCO algorithm.\\n\\n\\nLau developed DISCO (â\\x80\\x9cdistributed inter-subject correlation observerâ\\x80\\x9d) on the basis of the inter-subject correlation (ISC) model from neurobehavioral imaging.\\n\\nIn traditional fMRI  the researcher must strictly limit the variables in order to study the correspondence between cognitive processes and brain regions. But results from such artificial lab settings are difficult to generalize to the complexities of real-life scenarios. Attending a concert  listening to a bedtime story  watching a movie â\\x80¦ the brain is subjected to the influence of a host of uncontrolled factors such as the environment  mood fluctuations  and spontaneous social interactions.\\n\\nThe ISC method is based on the following conjecture: in the same natural setting  assuming everyoneâ\\x80\\x99s brain has the same biological processes  identical encephalic regions should activate when different individuals encounter the same stimulus. For instance  if two people watching the same horror film together show similar heightened amygdala activity  then we may conclude that the amygdala is involved in the experience of fear. If the reactions of numerous individuals in the same natural setting are measured simultaneously and compared  one can safely ignore interference from most uncontrollable factors.\\n\\nIllustration of surveillance camera\\nLauâ\\x80\\x99s DISCO takes the ISC method to another level.\\n\\nAfter the Spring City Railway Station attack more than a decade ago  similar random mass killing incidents proliferated  like a contagious disease with no apparent transmission route. Perfectly ordinary individuals  their lives unremarkable until that moment  would suddenly transform into vortices of violence  lashing into crowds with butcher knives  poisoned needles  even broken bottles  and deal as much damage as possible before the police could intervene.\\n\\nAs in the epidemic of suicides among migrant workers years earlier  there was at first no consensus about the underlying cause. Was it the pressure of technology-dominated  â\\x80\\x9cultra-unrealâ\\x80\\x9d life in modern China  where centuries of progress elsewhere had been compressed into a handful of decades? Was it the manifestation of a conflicted society that had lost its old  failed ideals with nothing new to take their place? Or was it something darker?\\n\\nIn the end  the authorities announced that the perpetrators in every single case were determined to have suffered from a form of mental illness unlike any other  leading to outbreaks of extreme violence. Though there was an official Latinate name for the diagnosis  most people called it â\\x80\\x9cATGism â\\x80\\x9d for â\\x80\\x9cagainst the grain.â\\x80\\x9d Pressure mounted among the public to preemptively confine individuals deemed to suffer from this condition.\\n\\nHowever  traditional methods of psychiatric diagnosis left too much room for subjective interpretation  and the legal process for involuntary commitment was unwieldy and subject to abuse. The government became embroiled in controversy after controversy.\\n\\nAs the attacks continued  many began to question whether the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s involuntary commitment system was sufficient in preventing violence. At the same time  many patients who had been diagnosed using unreliable traditional methodsâ\\x80\\x94some of them showing no propensity to violence whatsoeverâ\\x80\\x94were deprived of personal liberty unjustly  resulting in much public anger. Yet the government couldnâ\\x80\\x99t simply abolish the old involuntary commitment system with nothing new to take its place  because many mental patients would be sent back to their families. Lingering prejudice against mental illnesses meant that many families  terrified  would cast these patients out into the streets  leading to even more social mayhem.\\n\\nJust when the Ministry of Mental Health was at its witsâ\\x80\\x99 end  DISCO arrived on the scene like a deus ex machina.\\n\\nDrawing on the enormous and comprehensive data bank of surveillance camera footage from mainland China and patient data from Huilongguan Mental Hospital  the largest psychiatric institution in Asia  Lau was able to train and iterate the DISCO algorithm hundreds of billions of times. Unlike traditional neuroimaging methods like MRI  PET  and DTI  which depend on specialized hardware  DISCO can diagnose  surveil  and warn of imminent violent outbursts from ATGism solely though voiceprints  nonverbal expressions  and changes in behavioral patterns.\\n\\nLau only intended for DISCO to become a reliable tool for diagnosis  so that the ill could be helped and the well could live in security. But the government had bigger ideas in mind.\\n\\nDISCO turned out to be easily adaptable for the T2000 Deep Gaze smart surveillance cameras  running as a distributed computing network. The algorithm was trained to recognize the new illness  but what other forms of deviance could catch its gaze?\\n\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t know whether the complexity of a human being can be reduced to a set of numbers  numbers that would then infallibly predict the propensity for violence. I do know that Professor Lau was identified by his own algorithm as a dangerous individual  and committed to compulsory treatment.\\n\\nDo I think heâ\\x80\\x99s mad? I must find him first.\\n\\n\\nWe begin with the most rudimentary form of investigation: talking to Professor Lauâ\\x80\\x99s family and friends one by one. As a fugitive  Professor Lau wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t dare expose his biometric data to the system  so thereâ\\x80\\x99s no point in searching hotel guest lists.\\n\\nWe wander through public housing tenements as densely packed as ant nests; underground eateries redolent of mold; long  dark  twisting corridors. We are scrutinized by suspicious eyes peering from behind rusty gates. Economic decline and stagnation are even more visible than when I left  the consequence of Hong Kongâ\\x80\\x99s loss of status as a special tariff territory in the West during the trade wars.\\n\\nWe find nothing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat should we do now?â\\x80\\x9d Ng Lok Tin asks as we sit down in CafÃ© de Coral.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet me think â\\x80\\x9d I muse. â\\x80\\x9cHe took great risks to come to Hong Kong after escaping from the treatment center. Why? Whatâ\\x80\\x99s he hoping to accomplish here?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe shrugs. Then his eyes brighten. â\\x80\\x9cOh  I invited him to come to our film festival a few months agoâ\\x80\\x94I guess he must already have been committed by thenâ\\x80\\x94but all I got was an automated e-mail response.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat film festival?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDidnâ\\x80\\x99t I tell you? Iâ\\x80\\x99m the neuroscience advisor for the Mind Wanderer Film Festival.â\\x80\\x9d Ng Lok Tin points out the window at an electronic billboard over the streets of East Tsim Sha Tsui  which is flashing through various film posters. â\\x80\\x9cTomorrow is our last day.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy would a film festival need a neuroscience advisor? I donâ\\x80\\x99t remember you being much of a film buff  either.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHey  that was years ago â\\x80\\x9d he says sheepishly. â\\x80\\x9cAnyway  now we use ISC technology in filmmaking too. I thought Professor Lau would enjoy seeing this alternate application of the technology.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs that why he came back?â\\x80\\x9d I mutter to myself. â\\x80\\x9cFilms â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs a young man  Professor Lau once dreamed of becoming a director  but his parents pressured him into medical school instead. Whenever he got a break in his busy schedule  he rushed to the cinema to catch a new showing. In our lab  he often conducted ISC studies using films as the stimuli. I suppose that was the best way he found of combining work and hobby.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you really think Professor Lau escaped from the hospital and the police just to see movies in Hong Kong?â\\x80\\x9d Ng Lok Tinâ\\x80\\x99s eyes widened with incredulity.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing so absurd.â\\x80\\x9d My mind churns  pondering this new angle. â\\x80\\x9cBut if youâ\\x80\\x99re telling me ISC is used in films  itâ\\x80\\x99s possible he wants to use his favorite research material to prove something. Like â\\x80¦ his sanity. Do you still have that automated e-mail reply from him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNg Lok Tin pulls up Professor Lauâ\\x80\\x99s e-mail on his phone. My eyes are drawn to the quote in the signature:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe mental defective league  in formation.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94One Flew Over the Cuckooâ\\x80\\x99s Nest (1975)\\n\\nI focus on the date of the e-mail: the very day he was involuntarily committed.\\n\\nAs he realized that his algorithm had begun to turn on him  did Professor Lau try to send a message through his e-mail signature in the same way he once tried to comfort me?\\n\\nWe narrow the possibilities down to nine showings  the only ones using ISC projection. Six of them are scheduled between tonight and tomorrow morning  and the last three will take place simultaneously tomorrow afternoon.\\n\\nFrom dusk to dawnâ\\x80\\x94from Yuen Long in the northeast to Sai Kung in the far westâ\\x80\\x94we rush to attend six ISC showings in six different theaters like a pair of fanatic cinephiles.\\n\\nAlong the way  Ng Lok Tin explains to me how the neuroimaging technique that led to DISCO found application in interactive entertainment.\\n\\nIn short  in ISC projection  miniaturized fMRI equipment is used to measure the neuroactivity of each audience member during key scenes. An ISC profile representative of the audienceâ\\x80\\x99s overall neural response is then generated. But if any individualâ\\x80\\x99s measured response is two or more standard deviations from the average profileâ\\x80\\x94essentially  if that personâ\\x80\\x99s neurological response to the key scene is sufficiently different from that of most peopleâ\\x80\\x94the individual will be shown a specially designed hidden subplot. ISC-enhanced films have become very popular in Hong Kong because everyone wants to see if their brain is so unique  so above the vulgar crowd like an elegant crane towering above a flock of chickens  as to be given the prize of the special hidden subplot.\\n\\nMaybe Professor Lau wants to use an ISC-enhanced film  powered by the same technology as the surveillance cameras  to prove that his neurological response does not deviate from the average profile.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut how do you show a different plot to only some people in the same theater?â\\x80\\x9d I ask  puzzled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll see for yourself soon.â\\x80\\x9d Ng Lok Tin grins mysteriously.\\n\\nNg Lok Tinâ\\x80\\x99s special advisor status gains us entry even after the start of a showing. As we tiptoe through each dark theater  we try to identify the man we seek among the hundreds of faces half hidden under helmets and eyepieces. We dare not bring up Lauâ\\x80\\x99s name  identity  or photograph to the staff or any audience member  lest we betray our intentions to special government agents after the same prey and perhaps lose our chance forever to find Professor Lau.\\n\\nEveryone in the audience has their neck and shoulders secured in place by rubber gear over the seat back in order to ensure clear neuroimaging scans. The silver helmets they all wear are attached to cables and processors behind the seats.\\n\\nThese helmets arenâ\\x80\\x99t for VR immersion; instead  the eyepieces are active shutter glasses synchronized with the projection screenâ\\x80\\x99s stroboflash  and the transmittance level of the liquid crystal lens can be altered many times per second. By carefully modulating the shuttering of eyepieces on two helmets  itâ\\x80\\x99s possible to show two viewers different frames from the same sequence. The refresh rate of the eyepieces must exceed 60Hz to prevent the brain from perceiving jitters. In order for the same screen to present two different dynamic pictures simultaneously during the ISC-enhanced segmentsâ\\x80\\x94one for the main film  the other for the hidden subplotâ\\x80\\x94the refresh rate of the screen must therefore exceed 120Hz.\\n\\nIllustration of mentioned \"active shutter glasses\"\\nA very clever designâ\\x80\\x94it preserves the communal experience of watching a film in a theater while leaving room for the select few to experience hidden subplots.\\n\\nBefore key scenes  a green light flashes from the movie screen  indicating that the audience should hold still. When the light turns red  the scan begins  each lasting 6 to 15 seconds while the movie plays on. The real-time scanning data is transmitted to the processors behind the seats  corrected for linear drift and standardized. Then each personâ\\x80\\x99s scan result is uploaded to calculate the group correlation coefficient on the same time series. Finally  each individualâ\\x80\\x99s result is compared with other results to determine the version of the film that the person will see next.\\n\\nAs we canvass one theater after another  we experience the downfall of a newspaper tycoon  a beautiful dance in the rain  a monster hatching from its cocoon  a roaring tide of blood gushing from a gate. In the darkness  itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to tell which eyepieces are out of sync with the others through a phone camera appâ\\x80\\x94like the different glows of sea glass and seashell in moonlight.\\n\\nWe never find Professor Lau in the audience.\\n\\nWe slump down onto the bench in front of the last theater at dawn. Even the golden sun canâ\\x80\\x99t cast away our clouds of frustration and weariness. The final three ISC showings are all in the afternoon  taking up the same time slot. Even if we split up and take one theater each  weâ\\x80\\x99ll miss the third showing  which means a one-third chance that weâ\\x80\\x99ll miss Professor Lau.\\n\\nBesides  our whole plan is founded on the unproven assumption that the signature in that auto-reply was a meaningful hint  not our own wishful thinking.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cISC projection is just a gimmick to get more people to come to the theaters  right?â\\x80\\x9d I tilt my head toward Ng Lok Tin.\\nInstead of directly answering  he poses a question of his own. â\\x80\\x9cDo you remember the argument we had right before graduation?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSure. Professor Lau invited us both to join his development team. You not only declined the offer right away but were also  frankly  quite rude.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was too immature back then â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d He bows his head  smiling awkwardly.\\n\\nI remember how Ng Lok Tin contradicted Professor Lau. There could never be an objective  unchanging definition of mental illness  he said; the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual constantly evolved and was updated as science and ethics advanced. The use of neuroimaging technology in the diagnosis of mental illnesses had to be carefully considered. Society defined madness as the result of a combination of medicine and politics. Ultimately  a comprehensive and compassionate diagnosis required accounting for neuroimaging  behavioral data  social mores  and a multiplicity of other factors. To give undue weight to certain factors simply because they were easily measurable would lead to far greater problems.\\n\\nProfessor Lau looked exasperated  but instead of refuting Ng Lok Tin  he had coldly waved him away.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHas your stance on this matter changed?â\\x80\\x9d I ask.\\n\\nNg Lok Tin seems to avoid my question. â\\x80\\x9cEven though ISC films are now all the rage in Hong Kong  did you know that the technology was invented first in Dongguan  the Chinese city striving to be the worldâ\\x80\\x99s entertainment technology leader? They beta-tested the technology in a few major theater chains  but the initial result was utter failure.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat happened? Because of censorship?â\\x80\\x9d In mainland China  cultural creativity is far less acceptable than technological creativity.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause no one ever saw the hidden subplots during the beta tests!â\\x80\\x9d Ng Lok Tin bursts into laughter. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you find that hilarious?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI roll my eyes at this attempt at cynicism; he turns somber.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou think letting a supposedly impartial algorithm define whoâ\\x80\\x99s mad or deviant will help people live with more dignity and security â\\x80\\x9d Ng Lok Tin says. â\\x80\\x9cBut I believe the only thing the algorithm is good for is entertainment.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhen Professor Lau invited his two favorite students to join his project  Ng Lok Tin and I made opposite choices. I followed my mentor up north to the mainland to develop his embryonic technology under government support. I saw no future for myself in Hong Kong  where nostalgia for a past that never was made people fearful of embracing the new. An algorithm that would pinpoint sources of violence couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be perfected without evolution in the real world  with real data  with real patients  with real consequences.\\n\\nNg Lok Tin  on the other hand  stayed behind in the ivory tower  intending to construct a delicate palace of theory woven from jargon and numbers and seek a perfect solution that would somehow account for all the factors.\\n\\nNow  a decade later  the plots of both our lives seem to have taken unexpected turns.\\n\\nTwo years ago  on the verge of mass deployment of DISCO surveillance  Professor Lau transferred me out of the core research group with the official excuse that I would be â\\x80\\x9cappointed with other tasks.â\\x80\\x9d I was set up with a sinecure in a mental-health management agency in Shenzhen. Professor Lau never gave me a clear explanation of the abrupt change  but deep down  I knew that it was because of what happened that rainy night.\\n\\nHad he already lost faith in his algorithm then? Did he send me away from the developing algorithm  hungry for all observation  to protect me? Iâ\\x80\\x99ll never know unless I find him.\\n\\nMeanwhile  back in Hong Kong  where residents took to the streets in protest and blocked the installation of DISCO-enhanced surveillance cameras  Ng Lok Tin ended up applying the same technique to peer into the deep recesses of every moviegoerâ\\x80\\x99s consciousness  manipulating them to indulge in the fantasy that they were somehow special enough to see a different story.\\n\\nTime makes us all traitors to the ideals of our youth. Humans are simply too complicated to be reduced to computable paths.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWere we wrong to assume that we knew Professor Lau well enough to predict what he would do?â\\x80\\x9d I let out a frustrated sigh.\\n\\nNg Lok Tin tries to comfort me. â\\x80\\x9cAs long as heâ\\x80\\x99s not actually mad  he must still follow patterns of behavior that are reasonable.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut even if weâ\\x80\\x99re right that he wants to come to the ISC showings  thereâ\\x80\\x99s no way the two of us can be at three different theaters at the same time.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAll three showings are of the same film: Wong Kar-Waiâ\\x80\\x99s In the Mood for Love. Preoccupied  Ng Lok Tin stares at the qipao-clad woman on the poster. Lights blink around the poster  like robotic stars.\\n\\nHe yelps and jumps to his feet.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m going to take you where you can see three movie showings at once.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\nWe arrive at the central control room at the Broadway Cinematheque in Yau Ma Tei. Here  we can see the real-time data from all three ISC showings visualized in arrays of lights. The other two showings are happening at the Grand Windsor Cinema at Causeway Bay and the Movie Town at Sha Tin New Town Plaza.\\n\\nThe staff checks and double-checks all the equipment. A countdown begins on the big command screen as though the place is about to launch a rocket instead of showing an old film about an extramarital affair. The director  known for his protectiveness  wonâ\\x80\\x99t allow theaters to modify frames from the original film by adding flashing ISC signals for key scenes. Therefore  the theater has erected electronic call-boards next to the screen to remind the viewers when they should be prepared for scanning.\\n\\nThis gives us a chance.\\n\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve never liked this movie  not because of the story itself  but because the artistic shotsâ\\x80\\x94streets full of buildings imitating a past that never existed  Tong Lau tenements  and drenching storms that one never learns to expectâ\\x80\\x94call forth memories that pour down on me like heavy rain  until I feel Iâ\\x80\\x99m drowning.\\n\\nNg Lok Tin notices my discomfort. He wraps an arm around my shoulder and reassures me that weâ\\x80\\x99ll find Professor Lau no matter what.\\n\\nHe knows nothing of the tumult in my brain right now.\\n\\nFinally  the movie arrives at that well-known scene in the Goldfinch Restaurant. The dim glow of the light  the green tablecloth  and the wallpaper enhance romantic tension. Maggie Cheung  in a qipao  stirs her coffee with a small spoon. Tony Leung  sitting across from her  frowns  a look of melancholy in his eyes. In the next scene  these neighbors will come to terms with the ugly truth: their spouses are having an affair with one another.\\n\\nThe ISC countdown begins  reminding the audience to sit still and prepare for scanning.\\n\\nA line of text appears on the call-board.\\n\\nProfessor Lau  thank you for finding me. â\\x80\\x94Kiu\\n\\nFor most in the audience  this non sequitur  a little sappy  seems utterly incongruous with the tense  oppressive mood of the scene on the screen  a bit of random irrelevance to be ignored. It isnâ\\x80\\x99t meant for them.\\n\\nBut for Professor Lau  if he is among the audience  his brain should automatically seize upon the stimulus  trigger the retrieval of a certain long-ago memory from the hippocampus  and prompt the amygdala to produce an intense emotional response.\\n\\nA rainy night 10 years ago.\\n\\nI remember nothing of the beginning of the episode. After it was all over  my classmates informed me that after suffering a sudden breakdown  I had run out of my room and disappeared into the unexpected storm  through the faux-antique streets  past the buildings blurred by rain. My friends looked for me everywhere without success.\\n\\nAs I regained consciousness  I realized that I was standing outside the libraryâ\\x80\\x99s 24-hour study room with a jagged piece of broken glass in my hand. The students inside  their heads still buried in books  had no idea how close to death they had come. In fact  they were unaware of even my presence.\\n\\nProfessor Lau crouched before me  a wan smile on his face. Blood gushed from the deep wound in his palm  dribbled down his fingertips  pooled in a deep crimson patch at his feet.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEverything is okay now  Ah-Kiu. I found you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe and I are the only ones to know what happened that night.\\n\\nI could have been committed. I could have lost everything. But he had found me and kept my secret. Why did he trust that there would be no further episodes from me? Why did he believe I had stepped back from the brink of madness?\\n\\nThere are no answers for some questions. Human beings are too complicated.\\n\\nThe arrays of glowing dots representing the ISC coefficients of the audiences at all three theaters light up simultaneously; like hundreds of twinkling blue stars  they brighten and dim in synchrony  as though breathing. Abruptly  one dot flashes orange instead of blue  but after a split second  it blends back into the anonymity of the arrays.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCauseway Bay!â\\x80\\x9d I dash for the door.\\n\\n\\nIt only takes 13 minutes to get to Causeway Bay via the Cross Harbor Tunnel  as long as traffic doesnâ\\x80\\x99t get in the way  but the car ride feels like an eternity. On the way  Ng Lok Tin and I make plans for every contingency. But the hardest factor of all to control is how Professor Lau will react upon seeing us.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSee? Itâ\\x80\\x99s impossible to predict individual behavior because even the smallest disturbance can lead to major deviations.â\\x80\\x9d I have no idea how Ng Lok Tin can still be in the mood for a lecture. â\\x80\\x9cYet when we change the scale and examine humanity as a collective  we can easily discern predictable patterns.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hope that Professor Lau and you can continue your debate from 10 years ago. You have new arguments  and no doubt he does too.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNg Lok Tin shrugs  as if to say that he will most definitely win.\\n\\nBy the time we enter the theater  the credits are already rolling. Slowly  Ng Lok Tin and I search through the darkness  squinting at the faces in each row. All of them  half-hidden beneath helmets and bathed in a silver light  look the same to me. I move as slowly and softly as possible; I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to miss or startle the man.\\n\\nNg Lok Tin and I stop at the same row.\\n\\nProfessor Lau has already removed his helmet; the massive screenâ\\x80\\x99s silver glow glistens on his bare face. He gives me a look and points at the screen.\\n\\nI turn. A quote from TÃªte-BÃªche  the novel on which In The Mood for Love is based  floats on the screen. In French  tÃªte-bÃªche refers to a pair of adjoining stamps printed upside-down relative to each other.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe remembers those vanished years. As though looking through a dusty windowpane  the past is something he could see  but not touch. And everything he sees is blurred and indistinct. If he could break through that dusty windowpane  he would return to those vanished years.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMy eyes dart back to the man  fearful that heâ\\x80\\x99ll disappear into the crowd at any moment.\\n\\nInstead  he walks up to us. Ng Lok Tin staggers over to join our reunion.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProfessor Lau  we found you â\\x80\\x9d I blurt out.\\n\\nIn the darkness  everyone is waiting for the end of the film.\\n\\nProfessor Lau Gim Wai smiles  as though to say  Itâ\\x80\\x99s not you who found me  but I who found you.\\n\\nSome things  like that orange glow deviating from a sea of blue  can be measured and ascertained. But what cannot be measured is the meaning behind that glow  the rainy night  the broken glass  the faith that madness and sanity  deviance and conformity  cannot be so easily pinned down.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI need your help â\\x80\\x9d he whispers. â\\x80\\x9cDISCO is fatally flawed. Nuances of life neglected by the algorithm are critical in determining the fate of an individualâ\\x80\\x94or rather  the fate of multitudes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSmiling  Ng Lok Tin and I look at each other. This is not the ending  but the beginning of a new subplot.\\n\\nChen Qiufan (a.k.a.

Fake faces made by Nvidia\\'s researchers. Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning These incredibly realistic fake faces show how algorithms can now mess with us A new approach to AI fakery can generate incredibly realistic faces  with whatever characteristics you  d like. by     Will Knight Dec 14  2018 Fake faces made by Nvidia\\'s researchers. The faces above don  t seem particularly remarkable. They could easily be taken from  say  Facebook or LinkedIn. In reality  they were dreamed up by a new kind of AI algorithm. Nvidia researchers posted details of the method  for producing completely imaginary fake faces with stunning  almost eerie  realism (here  s  the paper ). The researchers  Tero Karras  Samuli Laine  and Timo Aila  came up with a new way of constructing a generative adversarial network  or GAN. GANs employ two dueling neural networks to train a computer to learn the nature of a data set well enough to generate convincing fakes. When applied to images  this provides a way to generate often highly realistic fakery. The same Nvidia researchers have previously used the technique to create  artificial celebrities  (read our  profile of the inventor of GANs  Ian Goodfellow ). Nvidia makes the computer chips that are crucial to artificial intelligence  but the company also employs an army of software engineers to develop useful tools and to experiment with new ways of using its hardware. Nvidia\\'s fake celebrity faces (top two rows)  and its new  more realistic fake faces below. The images below shows how much of an improvement the new work is.\\n\\nIn the most recent work  the researchers took inspiration from a technique known as style transfer to built their GAN in a fundamentally different way. This allowed their algorithm to identify different elements of a face  which the researchers could then control. A video produced by the researchers shows how the approach can also be used to play with  and remix  different elements  like age  race  gender  or even freckles.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt surely seems like another big quality leap for GANs â\\x80\\x9d says Mario Klingemann  an artist and coder who uses GANs in his work. â\\x80\\x9cIt also appears to be amazingly controllable  unlike GANs so far where you have to experimentally figure out how to steer the results into a certain direction (like making a face smile or age it).â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nKlingemann says he is keen to get his hands on the code  and to experiment with it for artistic purposes. â\\x80\\x9cI am very interested to find out how to make that model do â\\x80\\x98wrongâ\\x80\\x99 things â\\x80\\x9d he says.\\n\\nGANs are likely to change the way video games and special effects are generated. The approach could conjure up realistic textures or characters on demand. Nvidia recently showed a project that uses GANs to synthesize the appearance of objects in a scenes in real time within a driving game. \\n\\nAdobe also has a project that uses GANs to improve the realism of images after they have been manipulated  removing artifacts that can easily be introduced. GANs can also be used to sharpen up degraded images or video. \\n\\nBut the work is also a striking example of how advances in machine learning are leading to all sorts of new possibilities for fakery. We  wrote about the potentially for video fakery to harm political discourse in a special issue dedicated to politics earlier this year (see â\\x80\\x9cFake America great againâ\\x80\\x9d).\\n  Ethical Tech Dec 13  2018 All automated hiring software is prone to bias by default A  new report  out from nonprofit Upturn analyzed some of the most prominent hiring algorithms on the market and found that by default  such algorithms are prone to bias. The hiring steps:  Algorithms have been made to automate four primary stages of the hiring process: sourcing  screening  interviewing  and selection. The analysis found that while predictive tools were rarely deployed to make that final choice on who to hire  they were commonly used throughout these stages to reject people. When bias creeps in:  If past hiring data is used  the training information can be biased or unrepresentative  carrying these biases over to the software. Just removing data about gender and race won  t keep bias out of software. Other pieces of information  like distance from the office  can correlate strongly to more sensitive factors. Amazon saw this in a hiring algorithm it tried to develop. Hiring managers can also be prone to giving too much credence to the recommendations made by hiring algorithms. Regulating AI:  The study also found that the current laws aren  t equipped to deal with the problem. The laws designed to regulate human hiring decisions don  t easily allow for investigation and enforcement when dealing with machine-based discrimination. The positives:  On the other hand  predictive tools can help uncover past human biases and assumptions that had previously been overlooked. This would allow companies to make positive changes in their practices.   Several vendors are taking steps not only to audit their products for bias  but building equity-promoting features into their products  says one of the report  s authors  Miranda Bogen.   We hope more vendors will embrace these types of interventions  but there  s still a long way to go before we can be confident that predictive tools aren  t causing more harm than benefit. Fixing the problem:  To make the use of hiring AIs more fair  the report recommends:        allowing independent auditing of employer and vendor software        having governments update their regulations to cover predictive hiring software        scrutinizing ad and job platforms in more detail to analyze their growing influence on hiring   Because there are so many different points in that process where biases can emerge  employers should definitely proceed with caution  says Bogen.   They should be transparent about what predictive tools they are using and take whatever steps they can to proactively detect and address biases that arise  and if they can  t confidently do that  they should pull the plug.

Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics Canada and France plan an international panel to assess AI  s dangers Other nations may soon join a council to discuss the impact and the potential of artificial intelligence. by     Will Knight Dec 6  2018 The Canadian Prime Minister  Justin Trudeau  speaks in Montreal. Element AI. As China and the United States battle to dominate the development of artificial intelligence  Canada and France are asserting themselves as leaders in the escalating ethical debate over the technology. Canada  s prime minister  Justin Trudeau  and Mounir Mahjoubi  the French secretary of state for digital affairs  announced plans for the International Panel on Artificial Intelligence this week at the G7 nations   meeting in Montreal to discuss the impacts of artificial intelligence. According to  a mandate  issued by the prime minister  s office  the ongoing international coalition will bring together AI engineers and other scientists to assess the dangers of the technology and formulate appropriate policies among participating nations.   If Canada is to become a world leader in AI  we must also play a lead role in addressing some of the ethical concerns we will face in this area  Trudeau said at the end of the G7 Multi-Stakeholder Conference on Artificial Intelligence. He and French president Emmanuel Macron had revealed a collaboration on the subject earlier this year but provided few details at the time. In an interview after Trudeau  s speech  Mahjoubi said that France and Canada have made progress in persuading other nations to join the cause.   We already have partners who want to join us on this panel  Mahjoubi said.   I can  t announce any countries  but I can tell you there will be G7 members and there will be EU members. Mahjoubi said the panel would ideally cover issues such as AI ethics and autonomous weapons  although he noted that the latter is already being discussed internationally. He also said that the coalition would invite all nations  including China  to work on standards and norms for the technology. China has come under particular criticism for rapidly deploying AI in surveillance and policing.   Should we talk to China about the field? Of course  Mahjoubi said.   It  s also our responsibility to create a set of common values  and to say it loud  and to be able to show why our system of values is more resonant. Canada and France might not have the financial or commercial might of the United States or China  but they have played an outsize role in the recent development of artificial intelligence. Notably  some major figures in AI from French and Canadian research institutions have been prominent in the field  s most successful trend  deep learning. In addition to producing prominent AI researchers  the two nations have also launched national AI plans. France announced its $1.85 billion plan earlier this year  while Canada invested $125 million into a Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy (CIFAR)  centered on new research institutes in Edmonton  Montreal  and Toronto. This effort has created new research posts and projects  and it has prompted major tech companies to establish research centers around Canada  s AI hubs. At the same event  Trudeau announced $230 million in funding for a Canadian initiative  called  Scale AI   that aims to apply artificial intelligence to supply-chain logistics. Last February  the Canadian government announced that a total of $950 million would be invested in various technology-focused superclusters across the country by 2023. Canada currently holds the presidency of the G7  a group of the seven largest advanced economies in the world. At the G7 event  Navdeep Bains  the Canadian minister of innovation  said that concern over the impact of AI on jobs was a big theme during the meetings.   We  re very optimistic about AI  but I think we need to genuinely recognize the challenges and fears that exist as well  Bains said.

Chief among them is the way machine learning can identify people  s faces in photos and video footage with great accuracy. This might let you unlock your phone with a smile  but it also means that governments and big corporations have been given a powerful new surveillance tool. A new report from the  AI Now Institute  (large PDF)  an influential research institute  based in New York  has just identified facial recognition as a key challenge for society and policymakers. The speed at which facial recognition has grown comes down to the rapid development of a type of machine learning known as  deep learning . Deep learning uses large tangles of computations  very roughly analogous to the wiring in a biological brain  to recognize patterns in data. It is now able to carry out pattern recognition with jaw-dropping accuracy.  The tasks that deep learning excels at include identifying objects  or indeed individual faces  in even poor-quality images and video. Companies have rushed to adopt such tools. Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No The report calls for the US government to take general steps to improve the regulation of this rapidly moving technology amid much debate over the privacy implications.   The implementation of AI systems is expanding rapidly  without adequate governance  oversight  or accountability regimes  it says. The report suggests  for instance  extending the power of existing government bodies in order to regulate AI issues  including use of facial recognition:   Domains like health  education  criminal justice  and welfare all have their own histories  regulatory frameworks  and hazards. It also calls for stronger consumer protections against misleading claims regarding AI; urges companies to waive trade-secret claims when the accountability of AI systems is at stake (when algorithms are being used to make critical decisions  for example); and asks that they govern themselves more responsibly when it comes to the use of AI. And the document suggests that the public should be warned when facial-recognition systems are being used to track them  and that they should have the right to reject the use of such technology. Implementing such recommendations could prove challenging  however: the toothpaste is already out of the tube. Facial recognition is being adopted and deployed incredibly quickly. It  s used to unlock Apple  s latest iPhones and enable payments  while Facebook scans millions of photos every day to identify specific users. And just this week  Delta Airlines announced  a new face-scanning check-in system  at Atlanta  s airport. The US Secret Service is also developing a facial-recognition security system for the White House  according to  a document  highlighted by UCLA.   The role of AI in widespread surveillance has expanded immensely in the U.S.  China  and many other countries worldwide  the report says. In fact  the technology has been adopted on an even grander scale in China. This often involves collaborations between private AI companies and government agencies. Police forces have used AI to identify criminals  and numerous reports suggest it is being used to track dissidents. Even if it is not being used in ethically dubious ways  the technology also comes with some in-built issues. For example  some facial-recognition systems have been shown to encode bias. The ACLU researchers demonstrated that a tool offered through Amazon  s cloud program is  more likely to misidentify minorities as criminals . The report also warns about the use of emotion tracking in face-scanning and voice detection systems. Tracking emotion this way is relatively unproven  yet it is being used in potentially discriminatory ways  for example  to track the attention of students.   It  s time to regulate facial recognition and affect recognition  says Kate Crawford  cofounder of AINow and one of the lead authors of the report.   Claiming to   see   into people  s interior states is neither scientific nor ethical. Share Link Tagged AI Ethics Author Will Knight Popular 0   1   .

Doug Maloney/Unsplash Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics Can you make an AI that isn  t ableist? IBM researcher Shari Trewin on why bias against disability is much harder to squash than discrimination based on gender or race. by     Karen Hao Nov 28  2018 Doug Maloney/Unsplash Artificial intelligence has a well-known bias problem  particularly when it comes to race and gender. You may have seen some of the headlines: facial recognition systems that  fail to recognize black women   or automated recruiting tools that  pass over female candidates . But while researchers have tried hard to address some of the most egregious issues  there  s one group of people they have overlooked: those with disabilities. Take self-driving cars. Their algorithms rely on training data to learn what pedestrians look like so the vehicles won  t run them over. If the training data doesn  t include people in wheelchairs  the technology could put those people in life-threatening danger. For Shari Trewin  a researcher on IBM  s accessibility leadership team  this is unacceptable. As part of a  new initiative   she is now  exploring  new design processes and technical methods to mitigate machine bias against people with disabilities. She talked to us about some of the challenges  as well as some possible solutions. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Why is fairness to people with disabilities a different problem from fairness concerning other protected attributes like race and gender? Disability status is much more diverse and complex in the ways that it affects people. A lot of systems will model race or gender as a simple variable with a small number of possible values. But when it comes to disability  there are so many different forms and different levels of severity. Some of them are permanent  some are temporary. Any one of us might join or leave this category at any time in our lives. It  s a dynamic thing. Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No About one in five people in the US currently have a disability of some kind. So it  s really prevalent but hard to pin down into a simple variable with a small number of possible values. There might be a system that discriminates against blind people but not against deaf people. So testing for fairness becomes much harder. Disability information is also very sensitive. People are much more reluctant to reveal it than gender or age or race information  and in some situations itâ\\x80\\x99s even illegal to ask for this information. So a lot of times in the data youâ\\x80\\x99re much less likely to know anything about disabilities that a person may or may not have. That also makes it much harder to know if you have a fair system.\\n\\nI wanted to ask you about that. As humans  we decided the best way to avoid disability discrimination is to not reveal disability status. Why wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t that hold true for machine-learning systems?\\n\\n\\nShari Trewin  researcher on IBM\\'s Accessibility Leadership team\\nCOURTESY OF IBM\\nYeah  thatâ\\x80\\x99s the first thing people think of: if the system doesnâ\\x80\\x99t know anything about individualsâ\\x80\\x99 disability status  surely it will be fair. But the problem is that the disability often impacts other bits of information that are being fed into the model. For example  say I am a person that uses a screen reader to access the web  and Iâ\\x80\\x99m doing an online test for a job application. If that test program isnâ\\x80\\x99t well designed and accessible to my screen reader  itâ\\x80\\x99s going to take me longer to navigate around the page before I can answer the question. If that time isnâ\\x80\\x99t taken into consideration in assessing me  then anybody whoâ\\x80\\x99s using that same tool with a similar disability is at a systematic disadvantageâ\\x80\\x94even if the system doesnâ\\x80\\x99t know that Iâ\\x80\\x99m blind.\\n\\nSo if there are so many different nuances to disability  is it actually possible to achieve fairness?\\n\\nI think the more general challenge for the AI community is how to handle outliers  because machine-learning systemsâ\\x80\\x94they learn norms  right? They optimize for norms and donâ\\x80\\x99t treat outliers in any special way. But oftentimes people with disabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t fit the norm. The way that machine learning judges people by who it thinks theyâ\\x80\\x99re similar toâ\\x80\\x94even when it may never have seen anybody similar to youâ\\x80\\x94is a fundamental limitation in terms of fair treatment for people with disabilities.\\n\\nWhat would work a lot better would be a method that combines machine learning with some additional solution  like logical rules that are implemented in a layer above. There are also some situations where more attention to gathering a more diverse data set would definitely help. Some people are experimenting with techniques where you take out the core of the data and try to train for the outliers. Others are experimenting with different learning techniques that might optimize better for outliers rather than the norm.\\n\\nI think itâ\\x80\\x99s only when you start thinking about disability that you start thinking about the diversity of individuals and the importance of outliers. If you donâ\\x80\\x99t have enough gender diversity in your data set  you can fix that. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not so easy to fix disability diversity.\\n\\nHow do you get over the problem of people being private about their disability status?\\n\\nYeah  in order to test a system for fairness  you need some data. And people with disabilities providing that data is a social good  but itâ\\x80\\x99s a personal risk. People with disabilities are often easily identified even in anonymous data  just because theyâ\\x80\\x99re so unique. So how do we mitigate that? Weâ\\x80\\x99re still figuring that out.\\n\\nWhat are your greatest concerns about this problem?\\n\\nOftentimes AI systems are optimizing something that is not the wellbeing of the people who are affected by the decisions. That impact needs to have much more prominence in the design process  so that weâ\\x80\\x99re not just introducing a system that looks at how much money weâ\\x80\\x99re saving or how efficiently weâ\\x80\\x99re processing people. We need new ways of measuring systems that incorporate the aspect of impact on the end users  especially if itâ\\x80\\x99s a disadvantaged group.\\n\\nHow would we do that?\\n\\nTesting for fairness is one way of measuring that impact. Including the disadvantaged group in the design process and hearing their concerns is another. Even explicitly including some metric for stakeholder satisfaction that you could measure through interviews or surveysâ\\x80\\x94that sort of thing.\\n\\nWhat are the things that youâ\\x80\\x99re excited about in this area of research?\\n\\nAI technologies are already changing the world for people with disabilities by providing them with new capabilities  like applications that tell you whatâ\\x80\\x99s in your field of view when you point your phone.\\n\\nI think that if we do it right  thereâ\\x80\\x99s a real opportunity for AI systems to improve on previous human-only systems. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a lot of discrimination and bias and misunderstanding of people with disabilities in society today. If we can find a way to produce AI systems that eliminate that kind of bias  then we can start to change the treatment of people with disabilities and reduce discrimination.\\n  Chensiyuan/Wikimedia commons Artificial Intelligence Harvard researchers want to school Congress about AI A tech boot camp will teach US politicians and policymakers about the potential  and the risks  of artificial intelligence. by     Karen Hao Nov 14  2018 Chensiyuan/Wikimedia commons When Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg testified in front of the US Congress  technology experts quickly realized how poorly informed his questioners were. As much as Congress wanted to regulate the tech behemoth  it was clear they had no idea how. Instead  they let him get away with grandiose claims about how AI would solve all the company  s problems. For Dipayan Ghosh  a research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School (HKS)  the hearing emphasized the pressing need to bring US policymakers up to speed on major technology issues  and AI in particular.   AI is a tremendous technology  but there are really salient problems that we  ve seen take a life of their own in society  says Ghosh  who was a technology policy advisor in the Obama administration.   We need to inform people in positions of power about how these systems actually work  so the next time they launch a regulatory effort  they won  t be ill-informed. Ghosh is co-directing a  new AI policy initiative   launched today  with Tom Wheeler  a senior research fellow at HKS and the chairman of the US Federal Communications Commission under Obama. Funded by HKS  s Shorenstein Center on Media  Politics  and Public Policy  the initiative will focus on expanding the legal and academic scholarship around AI ethics and regulation. It will also host a boot camp for US Congress members to help them learn more about the technology. The hope is that with these combined efforts  Congress and other policymakers will be better equipped to effectively regulate and shepherd the growing impact of AI on society. Over the past year  a series of high-profile tech scandals have made increasingly clear the consequences of poorly implemented AI. This includes the use of machine learning to spread disinformation through social media and the automation of biased and discriminatory practices through facial recognition and other automated systems. In October  at the annual  AI Now Symposium   technologists  human rights activists  and legal experts repeatedly emphasized the need for systems to hold AI accountable.    The government has the long view  said Sherrilyn Ifill  president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.   They hold  in many ways  the responsibility of communicating history to the corporations and other companies that are developing these technologies. But the government lacks the knowledge to bear this responsibility  says Ghosh.   If you ask a member of Congress if AI is part of the disinformation problem  they might say   I don  t think so   or   I don  t know    he says. As part of the initiative  Ghosh and Wheeler asked roughly 30 leading experts in computer science  philosophy  economics  and other fields to weigh in on issues including discrimination  fairness  transparency  and accountability. Those perspectives will be published over the following months  beginning with three this week: Catherine Tucker  a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management  on the economic context of algorithmic bias; M.C. Elish and Danah Boyd  research lead and founder of the Data & Society Research Institute  respectively  on the ethics of when and how to use AI systems without exacerbating existing injustice; and Joseph Turow  a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication  on the discriminatory consequences of hyper-personalized marketing. The initiative will host a boot camp in Washington  DC  next February for members of Congress and their technology policy staff to help translate the articles into productive policy discussions. The camp will explore what it means to design AI ethically and what regulatory measures could be taken to mitigate its harm and foster its benefits. Ghosh recognizes that the current political climate makes it difficult to align both parties toward any goal  but he is hopeful they will find common ground over the urgency of the issue.\\n  Freepik Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics How emotions underlie even the coldest human calculations Expert chess players run the gamut of feelings when solving chess problems  according to a study with significant implications for machine intelligence. by     Emerging Technology from the arXiv Nov 9  2018 Freepik It  s easy to imagine that emotion gets in the way of the most difficult decisions. Get rid of this cumbersome human artifact and surely people would be able to make cold  calculating choices in the most exacting of situations. Not so. Neuroscientists have long studied people with brain injuries that prevent them experiencing emotions. But instead of being precise  ruthless killers  these people are paralyzed by indecision. The truth is that when it comes to everyday choices  deciding between cheese or ham in your sandwich  for example  it doesn  t matter how much cold hard logic you bring to bear; these decisions are ultimately emotional. But what of more detailed calculations like those involved in mathematics or chess? Surely they can  t be governed by fickle human emotion? Actually  they can  say Thomas Guntz at the University of Grenoble in France and a few colleagues. These guys have measured the changes in emotional state experienced by chess players as they tackle increasingly difficult problems. And they say that emotions play a key role in helping players solve complex problems. The ability to automatically measure changes in human emotional states has advanced by leaps in bounds in recent years. Changes in pupil size are an indicator of concentration levels. Heart rate is a measure of arousal and can be monitored by looking for changes in the color of facial skin. Body posture and gestures also indicate emotional changes  and these are straightforward to monitor with 3-D cameras such as the Kinect. All this can be correlated with the object of a person  s attention  as measured by head orientation and eye gaze. Together  these indicators provide a comprehensive overview of an individual  s emotional state and how it changes from moment to moment. Guntz and co turned this powerful gaze to the emotional state of 30 expert and intermediate chess players as they solved increasingly challenging chess puzzles. Each puzzle required the player to checkmate an opponent. Puzzles that can be solved in one to three moves are considered easy  while those that require four to six moves are considered challenging. As the players tackled each problem  the team recorded changes in gaze  body posture  cardiac rhythm  facial expression  and so on. They then used this data to infer how each player  s emotional state changed during the task. For example  the player  s basic emotional state  happiness  sadness  anger  fear  disgust  or surprise  can be judged from his or her microexpressions; changes in cardiac rhythm suggest changes in arousal; and the rate of self-touching is a measure of stress. â\\x80\\x9c[Our results] revealed an unexpected observation of rapid changes in emotion as players attempt to solve challenging problems â\\x80\\x9d the researchers say.\\n\\nFor this reason  they think emotions must play a role in the decision-making process. â\\x80\\x9cOur current hypothesis is that the rapid changes in emotion are an involuntary display in reaction to recognition of previously encountered situations during exploration of the game state â\\x80\\x9d they say.\\n\\nThis must play a crucial role in pruning the decision tree of potential moves  think Guntz and co. The way advanced chess players do this pruning is very different from the thought process beginners use. Over time  expert players learn to recognize certain patterns of play or positions of strength and weakness.\\n\\nThis pattern recognition significantly simplifies the process of deciding on the next move. Instead of considering all the pieces separately  the top players consider them in groups called chunks. Top players are thought to store up to 100 000 of these chunks in long-term memory. When playing a game  they transfer these chunks into short-term memory  where the reasoning takes place.\\n\\nAnd thatâ\\x80\\x99s where players ought to run into trouble. There is a well-known limit on the amount of information that humans can store in short-term memory. Back in the 1960s  the American psychologist George Miller showed that we can store between five and nine chunks that way. Beyond that  we are overwhelmed.\\n\\nSo how do chess players manage 100 000 chunks when they can only hold a handful in their working memory at any one time?\\n\\nThey use emotion  say Guntz and co. When a player spots a chunk he or she has seen before  the valence associated with it causes it to be brought to the fore for further analysis or rejected as a bad option.\\n\\nIn this way  top players use emotion to move relevant chunks from long-term to short-term memory and back again. And it is this change in emotional state that the team was able to record.\\n\\nThat has huge implications for our understanding of human decision-making and for machine intelligence in general. Guntz and co are careful to temper their result with the suggestion that their work is still in its early stages and more needs to be done.\\n\\nBut it provides a curious new way to think about the problem of decision-making and how machines could do it more effectively. Until now  machines have mainly used increasingly powerful computational resources to make decisions. That effectively drains the mystery from problems like checkers  chess  and more recently Go. But ask them to choose between ham and cheese in a sandwich and theyâ\\x80\\x99re stumped.\\n\\nEmotions clearly provide some kind of indexing system that allows us to access certain memories more quickly. Understanding how that works and how it can be applied to machines is an important goal.\\n\\nRef: arxiv.org/abs/1810.11094 : The Role of Emotion in Problem Solving: First Results from Observing Chess  Ms. Tech Computing  /  Edge Computing Using Wi-Fi to   see behind closed doors is easier than anyone thought With nothing but a smartphone and some clever computation  researchers can exploit ambient signals to track individuals in their own homes. by     Emerging Technology from the arXiv Nov 2  2018 Ms. Tech Wi-Fi fills our world with radio waves. In your home  in the office  and increasingly on city streets  humans are bathed in a constant background field of 2.4- and 5-gigahertz radio signals. And when people move  they distort this field  reflecting and refracting the waves as they go. That  s given more than one group of researchers an interesting idea. In theory  they say  it ought to be possible to use this changing electromagnetic field to work out the position  actions  and movement of individuals. Indeed  several groups have created imaging systems that  use Wi-Fi to   see through walls . But all these systems have drawbacks. For example  they rely on knowing the exact position of the Wi-Fi transmitters involved and need to be logged in to the network so that they can send known signals back and forth. That isn  t possible for the ordinary snooper or peeping tom  who might typically have access only to off-the-shelf Wi-Fi sniffers such as those built into smartphones. This kind of set-up is just too basic to reveal any useful detail about what goes on behind closed doors  other than the presence of the Wi-Fi network itself. At least  that  s what everybody thought. Today that changes thanks to the work of Yanzi Zhu at the University of California  Santa Barbara  and colleagues. These guys have found a way to see through walls using ambient Wi-Fi signals and an ordinary smartphone. They say the new technique allows an unprecedented invasion of privacy.   Bad actors using smartphones can localize and track individuals in their home or office from outside walls  by leveraging reflections of ambient Wi-Fi transmissions  they say. First some background. If humans were able to see the world as Wi-Fi does  it would seem a bizarre landscape. Doors and walls would be almost transparent  and almost every house and office would be illuminated from within by a bright light bulb  a Wi-Fi transmitter. But despite the widespread transparency  this world would be hard to make sense of. That  s because walls  doors  furniture  and so on all reflect and bend this light as well as transmitting it. So any image would be impossibly smeared with confusing reflections. But this neednâ\\x80\\x99t be an issue if all you are interested in is the movement of people. Humans also reflect and distort this Wi-Fi light. The distortion  and the way it moves  would be clearly visible through Wi-Fi eyes  even though the other details would be smeared. This crazy Wi-Fi vision would clearly reveal whether anybody was behind a wall and  if so  whether the person was moving.\\n\\nThatâ\\x80\\x99s the basis of Zhu and coâ\\x80\\x99s Wi-Fi-based peeping tom. It looks for changes in an ordinary Wi-Fi signal that reveal the presence of humans.\\n\\nThe challenge is actually even harder than described  because Wi-Fi sniffers donâ\\x80\\x99t produce an image at all. The data that Zhu and co use is just a measurement of the signal strength at a specific location. That doesnâ\\x80\\x99t tell you anything about the location of the transmitter. And without knowing that  itâ\\x80\\x99s impossible to say where any human that distorts the field would be.\\n\\nSo the first step in the researchersâ\\x80\\x99 approach is to locate the Wi-Fi transmitter. They do this by measuring the change in the signal strength as they walk around outside the target building or room. Indeed  they have created an app that uses the smartphoneâ\\x80\\x99s built-in accelerometers to record this movement and then analyzes the change in signal strength as they move. In that way  it is possible to number-crunch the position of the transmitter  even in the presence of numerous reflections and distortions.\\n\\nIt is even possible to work out exactly where the transmitter sits inside a house  because floor plans of most homes and offices in the US are downloadable from places such as real estate websites.\\n\\nThe researchers say that by walking back and forth a few times outside a room or building  they can reliably locate the transmitter. â\\x80\\x9cWe found that consistency check across 4 rounds of measurements is sufficient to achieve room level localization of 92.6% accuracy on average â\\x80\\x9d they say.\\n\\nHaving done that  itâ\\x80\\x99s just a question of waiting. Provided nothing moves inside the target building  the Wi-Fi signal will be constant. But any small movement changes the signal in a way that is straightforward to measure.\\n\\nZhu and co show how various movements change the signal in different ways. For example  opening a door changes the field in two adjacent rooms and thus is straightforward to spot. Walking around creates large distortions  and even an action like typing creates small changes that a smartphone Wi-Fi receiver can pick up.\\n\\nThe team go on to say that they have tested this approach using Nexus 5 and Nexus 6 Android smartphones to peer into 11 different offices and apartments that the team had permission to observe  many of which contained several Wi-Fi transmitters.\\n\\nAdditional transmitters improve the accuracy of the approach. â\\x80\\x9cWe see that with more than 2 Wi-Fi devices in a regular room  our attack can detect more than 99% of the user presence and movement in each room we have tested â\\x80\\x9d say the researchers.\\n\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s not hard to imagine how a malicious actor might use this to work out if a building was occupied or empty.\\n\\nThe team say there are various defenses against this type of attack  such as geofencing Wi-Fi signals  but these are difficult to implement and have limited effectiveness. The most promising form of defense seems to be adding noise to the signals; the researchers are hoping to develop this in more detail in future.\\n\\nIn the meantime  this work suggests that the mere presence of Wi-Fi signals is a significant risk to privacy. â\\x80\\x9cWhile greatly improving our everyday life  [wireless transmissions] also unknowingly reveal information about ourselves and our actions â\\x80\\x9d say Zhu and co. For the moment  this risk has been largely overlooked. That will need to change quickly.\\n\\nRef: arxiv.org/abs/1810.10109 : Adversarial WiFi Sensing  A falsified image put through Serelay\\'s verification platform. Courtesy of Serelay Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning Deepfake-busting apps can spot even a single pixel out of place Two startups are using algorithms to track when images are edited  from the moment they  re taken. by     Karen Hao Nov 1  2018 Falsifying photos and videos used to take a lot of work. Either you used CGI to generate photorealistic images from scratch (both challenging and expensive) or you needed some mastery of Photoshopâ\\x80\\x94and a lot of timeâ\\x80\\x94to convincingly modify existing pictures.\\n\\nNow the advent of AI-generated imagery has made it easier for anyone to tweak an image or a video with confusingly realistic results. Earlier this year  MIT Technology Review senior AI editor Will Knight used off-the-shelf software to forge his own fake video of US senator Ted Cruz. The video is a little glitchy  but it wonâ\\x80\\x99t be for long. That same technology is creating a growing class of footage and photos  called â\\x80\\x9cdeepfakes â\\x80\\x9d that have the potential to undermine truth  confuse viewers  and sow discord at a much larger scale than weâ\\x80\\x99ve already seen with text-based fake news.\\n\\nThese are the possibilities that disturb Hany Farid  a computer science professor at Dartmouth College who has been debunking fake imagery for 20 years. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think weâ\\x80\\x99re ready yet â\\x80\\x9d he warns. But heâ\\x80\\x99s hopeful that growing awareness of the issue and new technological developments could better prepare people to discern true images from manipulated creations.There are two main ways to deal with the challenge of verifying images  explains Farid. The first is to look for modifications in an image. Image forensics experts use computational techniques to pick out whether any pixels or metadata seem altered. They can look for shadows or reflections that donâ\\x80\\x99t follow the laws of physics  for example  or check how many times an image file has been compressed to determine whether it has been saved multiple times.\\n\\nThe second and newer method is to verify an imageâ\\x80\\x99s integrity the moment it is taken. This involves performing dozens of checks to make sure the photographer isnâ\\x80\\x99t trying to spoof the deviceâ\\x80\\x99s location data and time stamp. Do the cameraâ\\x80\\x99s coordinates  time zone  and altitude and nearby Wi-Fi networks all corroborate each other? Does the light in the image refract as it would for a three-dimensional scene? Or is someone taking a picture of another two-dimensional photo?\\n\\nFarid thinks this second approach is particularly promising. Considering the two billion photos that are uploaded to the web daily  he thinks it could help verify images at scale. Two startups  US-based Truepic (which Farid consults for) and UK-based Serelay  are now working to commercialize this idea. They have taken similar approaches: each has free iOS and Android camera apps that use proprietary algorithms to automatically verify photos when taken. If an image goes viral  it can be compared against the original to check whether it has retained its integrity. \\n\\nWhile Truepic uploads its usersâ\\x80\\x99 images and stores them in its servers  Serelay stores a digital fingerprint of sorts by computing about a hundred mathematical values from each image. (The company claims that these values are enough to detect even a single-pixel edit and determine approximately what section of the image was changed.) Truepic says they choose to store the full images in case users want to delete sensitive photos for safety reasons. (In some instances  Truepic users operating in high-threat scenarios  like a war zone  need to remove the app immediately after they document scenes.) Serelay  in contrast  believes that not storing the photos affords users greater privacy.\\n\\n\\nSerelay is able to catch and highlight the missing flag in the photo.\\nCOURTESY OF SERELAY\\nAs an added layer of trust and protection  Truepic also stores all photos and metadata using a blockchainâ\\x80\\x94the technology behind Bitcoin that combines cryptography and distributed networking to securely store and track information.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not bulletproof â\\x80\\x9d Farid admits  and he says there are some downsides. For instance  users must use the verification software instead of the camera app in their phone. He also notes that companies that attempt to commercialize this kind of technology may prioritize monetization over security. â\\x80\\x9cThere is some trust we are putting in the companies building these apps â\\x80\\x9d he says.\\n\\nBut there are also mitigating strategies. Truepic and Serelay both offer software development kits to make their technology accessible to third-party platforms. Their idea is to one day make their verification technology an industry standard for digital cameras  including Facebookâ\\x80\\x99s  Snapchatâ\\x80\\x99s  or even Appleâ\\x80\\x99s native camera app. In that scenario  an unaltered image posted on social media could automatically receive a check mark  like a Twitter verification badge  indicating that it matches an image in their databaseâ\\x80\\x94a sign that Serelay hopes would establish trustworthiness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe vast majority of the content weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing online is taken with mobile devices â\\x80\\x9d says Farid. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s basically a handful of cameras out there that can incorporate this type of technology into their system  and I think youâ\\x80\\x99d have a pretty good solution.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nEach startup is now in early talks with social-media companies to explore the possibility of a partnership  and Serelay is also part of a new Facebook accelerator program called LDN_LAB.\\n\\nWhile the technology is not yet prevalent  Farid encourages people to use it by default when documenting high-stakes scenarios  whether those be political campaign speeches  human rights violations  or pieces of evidence at a crime scene. Truepic has already seen citizens use its app to document crises in Syria. Al Jazeera then used the verified footage to produce several videos. Both companies have also marketed their technology in the insurance industry as a verified way to document damage.Farid says itâ\\x80\\x99s important for companies doing this work to be transparent about their processes and work with trusted partners. That can help maintain user trust and keep bad actors away.\\n\\nWe still have a way to go to be fully prepared for the proliferation of deepfakes  he says. But heâ\\x80\\x99s hopeful. â\\x80\\x9cThe Truepic-type technology and the Serelay-type technology is in good shape â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cI think weâ\\x80\\x99re getting ready.â\\x80\\x9d  Artificial Intelligence Oct 31  2018 Harvard just put more than 6 million court cases online to give legal AI a boost After five years of work  nearly 6.5 million US court cases are now  available to access for free online . The news:  The Library Innovation Lab at the Harvard Law School Library has completed its  Caselaw Access Project   an endeavour to digitize every reported state and federal US legal case from the 1600s to last summer. The process involved scanning more than 40 million pages. Why is this needed?  One of the biggest hurdles to developing artificial intelligence for legal applications is the lack of access to data. To train their software  legal AI companies have often had to build their own databases by scraping whatever websites have made information public and making deals with companies for access to their private legal files. What it means:  Now that millions of cases are online for free  a good training source will be easily available. Programs will also be able to more easily search case text to provide lawyers with relevant background research for cases. As Adam Ziegler  the managing director of the Library Innovation Lab   told us last year :   I think there will be a lot more experimentation  and the progress will accelerate. It  s really hard to build a smart interface if you can  t get to the basic data. Share Link Tagged AI Ethics Author Erin Winick Image Richard Howe | Flickr Share Link Tagged AI Ethics Author Erin Winick Image Richard Howe | Flickr  Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics How gender bias influences Nobel Prizes Women receive Nobel Prizes in science significantly less often than might be predicted from their representation in those fields. But why? by     Emerging Technology from the arXiv Oct 26  2018 When Donna Strickland won the Nobel Prize in physics this year  she was the first woman to receive the honor in 55 years. The previous female winner  Maria Goeppert Mayer  was in 1963  for proposing the nuclear shell model of the atomic nucleus. Before that  Marie Curie received the prize in 1903 for her work on radioactivity. And that  s it. Between 1901 and 2018  the prize for physics has been awarded 112 times  but only three times to women. The prizes in chemistry  medicine  and economics reflect a similar imbalance. Of the 688 Nobel laureates in science  only 21 have been women. Of course  the gender gap in science is well known. So it  s easy to imagine that the small number of female laureates merely reflects this gap. But is this true  or are there other factors at work that have prevented women winning Nobel Prizes? Marie Curie Today we get an answer thanks to the work of Liselotte Jauffred at the University of Copenhagen and a couple of colleagues  who have compared the gender ratio among Nobel laureates with the gender ratio within their fields and say they do not match. Indeed  women are significantly more underrepresented in the list of Nobel Prize winners than they are in science.  The basic facts about prize winners are easy to gather well known. Laureates are on average 55 years old and thus are likely to be sampled from senior faculty members at universities around the world. They also receive the prize for work they did about 15 years earlier  on average. So today  s laureates were sampled from senior faculty members with a time lag of roughly 15 years. But determining the fraction of senior female faculty members relative to all senior faculty over the last hundred years or so is harder. Jauffred and co used data from the US National Science Foundation that lists faculty members at universities by gender and scientific discipline between 1973 and 2010. They assume this data can be used as a proxy for the global distribution of gender ratios. They then extrapolate to determine the gender ratio by discipline between 1901 and 2010. Finally  the team compared the historical gender ratios with the number of prizes awarded to women and searched for potential bias using a hierarchical Bayesian interference model. The results are unequivocal.   Female senior scientists are less likely to be awarded a Nobel Prize than their gender ratio suggests  say Jauffred and co.  But why? One possibility is that the Nobel committee unfairly evaluates nominations for women  but Jauffred and co discount that. Instead  they point to the many biases and hindrances that influence women throughout their careers  often before they become senior enough or influential enough to be considered for major prizes.   We speculate that there are limitations for women to enter the pool of very well esteemed scientists worthy of a nomination  say the researchers. For example  female laureates are significantly less likely to be married or have children than male laureates. That suggests family life limits the chances that women will enter this pool. Jauffred and co also say that men in academia are more likely to get the resources and support needed for excellent scientific work.   This suggests that men are more prone to end up in the pool of possible Nobel nominees  they say. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s interesting work that reveals the insidious influence of gender bias in science. â\\x80\\x9cStrikingly few Nobel laureates within medicine  natural and social sciences are women â\\x80\\x9d say Jauffred and co.\\n\\nThe question now is how best to change this situation so that women are equally and fairly represented.\\n\\nRef: arxiv.org/abs/1810.07280 : Gender Bias in Nobel Prizes  Simon Landrein Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics Should a self-driving car kill the baby or the grandma? Depends on where you  re from. The infamous   trolley problem was put to millions of people in a global study  revealing how much ethics diverge across cultures. by     Karen Hao Oct 24  2018 In 2014 researchers at the MIT Media Lab designed an experiment called Moral Machine. The idea was to create a game-like platform that would crowdsource peopleâ\\x80\\x99s decisions on how self-driving cars should prioritize lives in different variations of the â\\x80\\x9ctrolley problem.â\\x80\\x9d In the process  the data generated would provide insight into the collective ethical priorities of different cultures. \\n\\nThe researchers never predicted the experimentâ\\x80\\x99s viral reception. Four years after the platform went live  millions of people in 233 countries and territories have logged 40 million decisions  making it one of the largest studies ever done on global moral preferences. A new paper published in Nature presents the analysis of that data and reveals how much cross-cultural ethics diverge on the basis of culture  economics  and geographic location.\\n\\nThe classic trolley problem goes like this: You see a runaway trolley speeding down the tracks  about to hit and kill five people. You have access to a lever that could switch the trolley to a different track  where a different person would meet an untimely demise. Should you pull the lever and end one life to spare five?\\n\\nThe Moral Machine took that idea to test nine different comparisons shown to polarize people: should a self-driving car prioritize humans over pets  passengers over pedestrians  more lives over fewer  women over men  young over old  fit over sickly  higher social status over lower  law-abiders over law-benders? And finally  should the car swerve (take action) or stay on course (inaction)? Rather than pose one-to-one comparisons  however  the experiment presented participants with various combinations  such as whether a self-driving car should continue straight ahead to kill three elderly pedestrians or swerve into a barricade to kill three youthful passengers. \\n\\nThe researchers found that countriesâ\\x80\\x99 preferences differ widely  but they also correlate highly with culture and economics. For example  participants from collectivist cultures like China and Japan are less likely to spare the young over the oldâ\\x80\\x94perhaps  the researchers hypothesized  because of a greater emphasis on respecting the elderly. Countries with more individualistic cultures are more likely to spare the young\\n\\nSimilarly  participants from poorer countries with weaker institutions are more tolerant of jaywalkers versus pedestrians who cross legally. And participants from countries with a high level of economic inequality show greater gaps between the treatment of individuals with high and low social status.\\n\\nAnd  in what boils down to the essential question of the trolley problem  the researchers found that the sheer number of people in harmâ\\x80\\x99s way wasnâ\\x80\\x99t always the dominant factor in choosing which group should be spared. The results showed that participants from individualistic cultures  like the UK and US  placed a stronger emphasis on sparing more lives given all the other choicesâ\\x80\\x94perhaps  in the authors\\' views  because of the greater emphasis on the value of each individual. \\nCountries with more individualistic cultures are more likely to spare more lives\\n\\nCountries within close proximity to one another also showed closer moral preferences  with three dominant clusters in the West  East  and South.\\n\\nThe researchers acknowledged that the results could be skewed  given that participants in the study were self-selected and therefore more likely to be internet-connected  of high social standing  and tech savvy. But those interested in riding self-driving cars would be likely to have those characteristics also.\\n\\nThe study has interesting implications for countries currently testing self-driving cars  since these preferences could play a role in shaping the design and regulation of such vehicles. Carmakers may find  for example  that Chinese consumers would more readily enter a car that protected themselves over pedestrians.\\n\\nHow countries compare in sparing pedestrians over passengers\\n\\nBut the authors of the study emphasized that the results are not meant to dictate how different countries should act. In fact  in some cases  the authors felt that technologists and policymakers should override the collective public opinion. Edmond Awad  an author of the paper  brought up the social status comparison as an example. â\\x80\\x9cIt seems concerning that people found it okay to a significant degree to spare higher status over lower status â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cIt\\'s important to say  â\\x80\\x98Hey  we could quantify thatâ\\x80\\x99 instead of saying  â\\x80\\x98Oh  maybe we should use that.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d The results  he said  should be used by industry and government as a foundation for understanding how the public would react to the ethics of different design and policy decisions.\\n\\nAwad hopes the results will also help technologists think more deeply about the ethics of AI beyond self-driving cars. â\\x80\\x9cWe used the trolley problem because itâ\\x80\\x99s a very good way to collect this data  but we hope the discussion of ethics donâ\\x80\\x99t stay within that theme â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThe discussion should move to risk analysisâ\\x80\\x94about who is at more risk or less riskâ\\x80\\x94instead of saying whoâ\\x80\\x99s going to die or not  and also about how bias is happening.â\\x80\\x9d How these results could translate into the more ethical design and regulation of AI is something he hopes to study more in the future.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the last two  three years more people have started talking about the ethics of AI â\\x80\\x9d Awad said. â\\x80\\x9cMore people have started becoming aware that AI could have different ethical consequences on different groups of people. The fact that we see people engaged with thisâ\\x80\\x94I think that that\\'s something promising.â\\x80\\x9d  A time line of tech events that raise ethical questions  presented at the opening of the AI Now 2018 Symposium. Varoon Mathur/AI Now Institute Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics Establishing an AI code of ethics will be harder than people think Ethics are too subjective to guide the use of AI  argue some legal scholars. by     Karen Hao Oct 21  2018 A time line of tech events that raise ethical questions  presented at the opening of the AI Now 2018 Symposium. Varoon Mathur/AI Now Institute Over the past six years  the New York City police department has compiled  a massive database  containing the names and personal details of at least 17 500 individuals it believes to be involved in criminal gangs. The effort has already been criticized by civil rights activists who say it is inaccurate and racially discriminatory. \"Now imagine marrying facial recognition technology to the development of a database that theoretically presumes you  re in a gang \" Sherrilyn Ifill  president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense fund  said at the  AI Now Symposium  in New York last Tuesday. Lawyers  activists  and researchers emphasize the need for ethics and accountability in the design and implementation of AI systems. But this often ignores a couple of tricky questions: who gets to define those ethics  and who should enforce them?  Sherrilyn Ifill (NAACP Legal Defense Fund)  Timnit Gebru (Google)  and Nicole Ozer (ACLU) in conversation at the AI Now 2018 Symposium. Andrew Federman for AI Now Institute Not only is facial recognition imperfect   studies  have shown that the leading software is less accurate for dark-skinned individuals and women. By Ifill  s estimation  the police database is between 95 and 99 percent African American  Latino  and Asian American. \"We are talking about creating a class of [ ] people who are branded with a kind of criminal tag \" Ifill said. Meanwhile  police departments across the US  the UK  and China have begun adopting face recognition as a tool for finding known criminals. In June  the South Wales police  released  a statement justifying their use of the technology because of the \"public benefit\" that it provides. Indeed  technology often highlights peoples\\' differing ethical standards  whether it is  censoring hate speech  or using risk assessment tools to  improve public safety . The AI Now 2018 Symposium AI Now Institute In an attempt to highlight how divergent people  s principles can be  researchers at MIT created a platform called the  Moral Machine  to crowd-source human opinion on the moral decisions that should be followed by self-driving cars. They asked millions of people from around the world to weigh in on variations of the classic \" trolley problem \" by choosing who a car should try to prioritize in an accident. The results show huge variation across different cultures. Establishing ethical standards also doesn  t necessarily change behavior. In June  for example  after Google  agreed  to discontinue its work on Project Maven with the Pentagon  it established a fresh set of of ethical principles to guide its involvement in future AI projects. Only months later  many Google employees feel those principles have been placed by the wayside with a bid for a $10 billion Department of Defense contract. A recent study out of North Carolina State University also found that asking software engineers to read a code of ethics does nothing to change their behavior. Alston isnâ\\x80\\x99t the only one who has come up with this solution. Less than a week before the Symposium  the Data & Society Research Institute published a proposal for using international human rights to govern AI. The report includes recommendations for tech companies to engage with civil rights groups and researchers  and to conduct human rights impact assessments on the life cycles of their AI systems.\\n\\n\"Until we start bringing [human rights] into the AI discussion \" added Alston  \"thereâ\\x80\\x99s no hard anchor.\"\\n\\nPhilip Alston  an international legal scholar at NYUâ\\x80\\x99s School of Law  proposes a solution to the ambiguous and unaccountable nature of ethics: reframing AI-driven consequences in terms of human rights. \"[Human rights are] in the constitution \" Alston said at the same conference. \"Theyâ\\x80\\x99re in the bill of rights; theyâ\\x80\\x99ve been interpreted by courts \" he said. If an AI system takes away peopleâ\\x80\\x99s basic rights  then it should not be acceptable  he said.  Silicon Valley Oct 10  2018 Amazon ditched AI recruitment software because it was biased against women The data on which the artificial-intelligence algorithm was trained created a preference for male candidates. The news:  According to a report by  Reuters   Amazon began developing an automated system in 2014 to rank job seekers with one to five stars. But last year  the company scrapped the project after seeing it had developed a preference for male candidates in technical roles. Why?  The AI tool was trained on 10 years   worth of râ\\x88\\x9aÂ©sumâ\\x88\\x9aÂ©s the company had received. Because tech is a male-dominated industry  the majority of those râ\\x88\\x9aÂ©sumâ\\x88\\x9aÂ©s came from men. The result:  The system was unintentionally trained to choose male candidates over female candidates. It would reportedly penalize râ\\x88\\x9aÂ©sumâ\\x88\\x9aÂ©s containing the word   women  s or the names of certain all-women colleges. Although Amazon made changes to make these terms neutral  the company lost confidence that the program was indeed gender neutral in all other areas. Why it matters:  We can  t treat artificial intelligence as inherently unbiased. Training the systems on biased data means the algorithms  also become biased . If unfair AI hiring programs like this  aren  t uncovered before being implemented   they will perpetuate long-standing diversity issues in business rather than solve them.

Ms. Tech Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning Even the best AI for spotting fake news is still terrible It should be possible to automatically identify dubious news sources  but we  ll need a lot more data. by     Karen Hao Oct 3  2018 Ms. Tech When Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg  promised Congress  that AI would help solve the problem of fake news  he revealed little in the way of  how . New research brings us one step closer to figuring that out. In an extensive study that will be presented at a conference later this month  researchers from MIT  Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI)  and Sofia University in Bulgaria tested over 900 possible variables for predicting a media outlet  s trustworthiness  probably the largest set ever proposed.  The researchers then trained a machine-learning model on different combinations of the variables to see which would produce the most accurate results. The best model accurately labeled news outlets with   low    medium  or   high factuality just 65% of the time. This is far from a smashing success. But the experiments reveal important things about what it would take to outsource our fact-checking to a machine. Preslav Nakov  a senior scientist at QCRI and one of the researchers on the study  says he  s optimistic that sources of fake news can automatically be spotted this way. But that doesn  t mean it will be easy. Method to madness   \\n\\nIn the explosion of research on fake-news detection since the 2016 US presidential campaign  four main approaches have emerged: fact-checking individual claims  detecting fake articles  hunting down trolls  and measuring the reliability of news sources. Nakov and the rest of the team chose to focus on the fourth because it gets closest to the origin of misinformation. It has also been studied the least.\\n\\nPrevious studies tried to characterize the reliability of a news source by how many of its claims matched or conflicted with claims that had been fact-checked already. In other words  a machine would compare the history of factual claims made by a news outlet against the conclusions of sites like Snopes or PolitiFact. The mechanism  however  relies on human fact-checking and evaluates the history of the outlet  not the immediate present. By the time the latest claims have been manually fact-checked  â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s already too late â\\x80\\x9d says Nakov.\\n\\nTo spot a fake news source in close to real time  Nakov and his collaborators trained their system using variables that could be tabulated independently of human fact-checkers. These included analyses of the content  like the sentence structure of headlines and the word diversity in articles; overall site indicators  like the URL structure and website traffic; and measures of the outletâ\\x80\\x99s influence  like its social-media engagement and Wikipedia page  if any.\\n\\nTo select the variables  the researchers relied both on previous researchâ\\x80\\x94past studies have shown that fake news articles tend to have repetitive word choices  for exampleâ\\x80\\x94and on new hypotheses.\\n\\nBy testing different combinations of variables  the researchers were able to identify the best predictors for a news sourceâ\\x80\\x99s reliability. Whether an outlet had a Wikipedia page  for example  had an outsize predictive power; the outletâ\\x80\\x99s traffic  in contrast  had none. The exercise helped the researchers determine additional variables they could explore in the future.\\n\\nData starved\\n\\nBut there is one other obstacle: a shortage of training dataâ\\x80\\x94what Nakov calls the â\\x80\\x9cground truth.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFor most machine-learning tasks  itâ\\x80\\x99s simple enough to annotate the training data. If you want to build a system that detects articles about sports  you can easily label articles as related or unrelated to that topic. You then feed the data set into a machine so it can learn the characteristics of a sports article.\\n\\nBut labeling media outlets with high or low factuality is much more sensitive. It must be done by professional journalists who follow rigorous methodologies  and it is a time-intensive process. As a result  it is challenging to build up a solid corpus of training data  which is partly why the accuracy of the studyâ\\x80\\x99s model is so low. â\\x80\\x9cThe most obvious way to increase the accuracy is to get more training data â\\x80\\x9d says Nakov \\n\\nCurrently  Media Bias Fact Check  the organization chosen to supply the â\\x80\\x9cground truthâ\\x80\\x9d for the research  has evaluated 2 500 media sourcesâ\\x80\\x94a paucity in machine-learning terms. But Nakov says the organizationâ\\x80\\x99s database is growing quickly. In addition to obtaining more training data  the researchers are also looking to improve their modelâ\\x80\\x99s performance with more variables  some of which describe the structure of the website  whether it has contact information  and its patterns of publishing and deleting content. \\n\\nThey are also in the early stages of building a news aggregation platform that gives readers important cues to the trustworthiness of every story and source shared.\\n\\nDespite the work left to be done  Nakov thinks such technology can help resolve the fake-news epidemic relatively quickly if platforms like Facebook and Twitter earnestly exert the effort. â\\x80\\x9cIt is like fighting spam â\\x80\\x9d he wrote in a Skype message. â\\x80\\x9cWe will never stop fake news completely  but we can put them under control.â\\x80\\x9d  Artificial Intelligence Sep 28  2018 How DeepMind plans to stop AI from behaving badly Researchers at the Alphabet subsidiary DeepMind have spelled out how they will ensure that AI is developed safely. The guidelines  aim to make certain that powerful systems capable of learning and figuring out their own solutions to problems don  t start to behave in unexpected and unwanted ways. The big issues:  The researchers say the key challenges are  specifying  the intended behavior of a system in a way that avoids unwanted consequences; making it  robust  even in the face of unpredictability; and providing  assurances   or ways to override behavior if necessary. Erratic behavior: This is a growing area of academic research. There are plenty of often amusing examples of machine-learning systems that have started behaving oddly. Take  for example  the AI agent that taught itself a rather bizarre way to rack up points in the game CoastRunners. The AI learned it could accumulate more points not by finishing a race  as was intended  but by hitting certain obstacles around the course instead (as in the gif above). DeepMindâ\\x80\\x99s AI Safety team has also shown ways to have an AI agent shut itself off if it starts behaving in ways that might prove risky.\\n\\nFar out: We shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t worry unduly about AI systems becoming dangerously autonomous. In any case  there are far greater issues to worry about right now  including the bias that may lurk in AI algorithms or the fact that many machine-learning systems are difficult to understand.  Jake Belcher Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics How AI could help solve some of society  s toughest problems Machine learning and game theory help Carnegie Mellon assistant professor Fei Fang predict attacks and protect people. by     Charlotte Jee Sep 12  2018 Jake Belcher Fei Fang has saved lives. But she isn  t a lifeguard  medical doctor  or superhero. She  s an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University  specializing in artificial intelligence for societal challenges. At  MIT Technology Review   s   EmTech  conference on Wednesday  Fang outlined recent work across academia that applies AI to protect critical national infrastructure  reduce homelessness  and even prevent suicides.  Fang explained how a system she developed in 2013  while doing her PhD at the University of Southern California  is used every day to protect 60 000 passengers on the Staten Island Ferry in New York City. There are more ferries traveling between Staten Island and Manhattan than US Coast Guard patrol boats in the same territory. Previously  one patrol boat would follow one ferry for the whole journey  leaving the other ferries unprotected. Fang and her team created an algorithm that makes the patrol routes random and unpredictable  with regular speed changes and U-turns  in hopes of deterring nefarious actions against the ferries.    The feedback has been terrific. We  re protecting against potential attacks in high-risk zones by increasing randomness  making it harder to plan an attack  she told the audience at EmTech.   This can reduce the likelihood of a successful attack by half. Professional mariners have told us they now have better protection  but with the exact same number of boats  she added.  Fang  s AI work is not only protecting people. She has applied a similar approach to help prevent animal poaching in Uganda  Malaysia  and China. The PAWS (protection assistant for wildlife security) system she developed predicts which areas have a high threat of poaching  allowing patrols to better target their limited resources. Although the problems are different  the common solution lies in blending machine learning and game theory  she said.  Each challenge is conceptualized as a zero-sum  two-player game against two adversaries  where it  s very important to randomize patterns so it  s harder for attackers to find the weakest points. She outlined how colleagues in the field are adopting similar approaches to detect illegal mining sites  crack down on predatory payday lending  and predict crop yields to help prevent hunger.  â\\x80\\x9cThere is a huge potential to develop AI without an immediate commercial benefit  but for the good of all of society â\\x80\\x9d Fang said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI believe with our continuous efforts  we can leverage the positive aspects of AI and build a better world â\\x80\\x9d she added.  Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics Human translators are still on top  for now Machine translation works well for sentences but turns out to falter at the document level  computational linguists have found. by     Emerging Technology from the arXiv Sep 5  2018 You may have missed the popping of champagne corks and the shower of ticker tape  but in recent months computational linguists have begun to claim that neural machine translation now matches the performance of human translators. The technique of using a neural network to translate text from one language into another has improved by leaps and bounds in recent years  thanks to the ongoing breakthroughs in machine learning and artificial intelligence. So it is not really a surprise that machines have approached the performance of humans. Indeed  computational linguists have good evidence to back up this claim. But today  Samuel Laubli at the University of Zurich and a couple of colleagues say the champagne should go back on ice. They do not dispute their colleagues   results but say the testing protocol fails to take account of the way humans read entire documents. When this is assessed  machines lag significantly behind humans  they say. At issue is how machine translation should be evaluated. This is currently done on two measures: adequacy and fluency. The adequacy of a translation is determined by professional human translators who read both the original text and the translation to see how well it expresses the meaning of the source. Fluency is judged by monolingual readers who see only the translation and determine how well it is expressed in English. Computational linguists agree that this system gives useful ratings. But according to Laubli and co  the current protocol only compares translations at the sentence level  whereas humans also evaluate text at the document level. So they have developed a new protocol to compare the performance of machine and human translators at the document level. They asked professional translators to assess how well machines and humans translated over 100 news articles written in Chinese into English. The examiners rated each translation for adequacy and fluency at the sentence level but  crucially also at the level of the entire document. The results make for interesting reading. To start with  Laubli and co found no significance difference in the way professional translators rated the adequacy of machine- and human-translated sentences. By this measure  humans and machines are equally good translators  which is in line with previous findings. However  when it comes to evaluating the entire document  human translations are rated as more adequate and more fluent than machine translations. â\\x80\\x9cHuman raters assessing adequacy and fluency show a stronger preference for human over machine translation when evaluating documents as compared to isolated sentences â\\x80\\x9d they say.\\n\\nThe researchers think they know why. â\\x80\\x9cWe hypothesise that document-level evaluation unveils errors such as mistranslation of an ambiguous word  or errors related to textual cohesion and coherence  which remain hard or impossible to spot in a sentence-level evaluation â\\x80\\x9d they say.\\n\\nFor example  the team gives the example of a new app called â\\x80\\x9cå¾®ä¿¡æ\\x8cª è½¦ â\\x80\\x9d which humans consistently translate as â\\x80\\x9cWeChat Move the Carâ\\x80\\x9d but which machines often translate in several different ways in the same article. Machines translate this phrase as â\\x80\\x9cTwitter Move Car â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWeChat mobile â\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cWeChat Move.â\\x80\\x9d This kind of inconsistency  say Laubli and co  makes documents harder to follow.\\n\\nThis suggests that the way machine translation is evaluated needs to evolve away from a system where machines consider each sentence in isolation.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs machine translation quality improves  translations will become harder to discriminate in terms of quality  and it may be time to shift towards document-level evaluation  which gives raters more context to understand the original text and its translation  and also exposes translation errors related to discourse phenomena which remain invisible in a sentence-level evaluation â\\x80\\x9d say Laubli and co.\\n\\nThat change should help machine translation improve. Which means it is still set to surpass human translationâ\\x80\\x94just not yet.\\n\\nRef: arxiv.org/abs/1808.07048 : Has Machine Translation Achieved Human Parity? A Case for Document-level Evaluation  Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning Fake America great again Inside the race to catch the worryingly real fakes that can be made using artificial intelligence. by     Will Knight Aug 17  2018 Bruce Peterson Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning Guess what? I just got hold of some embarrassing video footage of Texas senator Ted Cruz singing and gyrating to Tina Turner. His political enemies will have great fun showing it during the midterms. Donald Trump will call him â\\x80\\x9cDancinâ\\x80\\x99 Ted.â\\x80\\x9d Okay  Iâ\\x80\\x99ll admit itâ\\x80\\x94I created the video myself. But hereâ\\x80\\x99s the troubling thing: making it required very little video-editing skill. I downloaded and configured software that uses machine learning to perform a convincing digital face-swap. The resulting video  known as a deepfake  shows Cruzâ\\x80\\x99s distinctively droopy eyes stitched onto the features of actor Paul Rudd doing lip-sync karaoke. It isnâ\\x80\\x99t perfectâ\\x80\\x94thereâ\\x80\\x99s something a little offâ\\x80\\x94but it might fool some people.\\n\\nPhoto fakery is far from new  but artificial intelligence will completely change the game. Until recently only a big-budget movie studio could carry out a video face-swap  and it would probably have cost millions of dollars. AI now makes it possible for anyone with a decent computer and a few hours to spare to do the same thing. Further machine-learning advances will make even more complex deception possibleâ\\x80\\x94and make fakery harder to spot.\\n\\nThese advances threaten to further blur the line between truth and fiction in politics. Already the internet accelerates and reinforces the dissemination of disinformation through fake social-media accounts. â\\x80\\x9cAlternative factsâ\\x80\\x9d and conspiracy theories are common and widely believed. Fake news stories  aside from their possible influence on the last US presidential election  have sparked ethnic violence in Myanmar and Sri Lanka over the past year. Now imagine throwing new kinds of real-looking fake videos into the mix: politicians mouthing nonsense or ethnic insults  or getting caught behaving inappropriately on videoâ\\x80\\x94except it never really happened.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDeepfakes have the potential to derail political discourse â\\x80\\x9d says Charles Seife  a professor at New York University and the author of Virtual Unreality: Just Because the Internet Told You  How Do You Know Itâ\\x80\\x99s True? Seife confesses to astonishment at how quickly things have progressed since his book was published  in 2014. â\\x80\\x9cTechnology is altering our perception of reality at an alarming rate â\\x80\\x9d he says.\\n\\nAre we about to enter an era when we canâ\\x80\\x99t trust anything  even authentic-looking videos that seem to capture real â\\x80\\x9cnewsâ\\x80\\x9d? How do we decide what is credible? Whom do we trust?\\nReal fake\\n\\nSeveral technologies have converged to make fakery easier  and theyâ\\x80\\x99re readily accessible: smartphones let anyone capture video footage  and powerful computer graphics tools have become much cheaper. Add artificial-intelligence software  which allows things to be distorted  remixed  and synthesized in mind-bending new ways. AI isnâ\\x80\\x99t just a better version of Photoshop or iMovie. It lets a computer learn how the world looks and sounds so it can conjure up convincing simulacra.\\n\\nI created the clip of Cruz using OpenFaceSwap  one of several face-switching programs that you can download for free. You need a computer with an advanced graphics chip  and this can set you back a few thousand bucks. But you can also rent access to a virtual machine for a few cents per minute using a cloud machine-learning platform like Paperspace. Then you simply feed in two video clips and sit back for a few hours as an algorithm figures out how each face looks and moves so that it can map one onto the other. Getting things to work is a bit of an art: if you choose clips that are too different  the result can be a nightmarish mishmash of noses  ears  and chins.\\n\\nBut the process is easy enough.\\nGetting things to work is a bit of an art: if you choose clips that are too different  the results can be a mishmash of noses  ears  and chins.\\n\\nFace-swapping was  predictably  first adopted for making porn. In 2017  an anonymous Reddit user known as Deepfakes used machine learning to swap famous actressesâ\\x80\\x99 faces into scenes featuring adult-movie stars  and then posted the results to a subreddit dedicated to leaked celebrity porn. Another Reddit user then released an easy-to-use interface  which led to a proliferation of deepfake porn as well as  for some odd reason  endless clips of the actor Nicolas Cage in movies he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t really in. Even Reddit  a notoriously freewheeling hangout  banned such nonconsensual pornography. But the phenomenon persists in the darker corners of the internet.\\n\\nOpenFaceSwap uses an artificial neural network  by now the go-to tool in AI. Very large  or â\\x80\\x9cdeep â\\x80\\x9d neural networks that are fed enormous amounts of training data can do all sorts of useful things  including finding a personâ\\x80\\x99s face among millions of images. They can also be used to manipulate and synthesize images.\\n\\nOpenFaceSwap trains a deep network to â\\x80\\x9cencodeâ\\x80\\x9d a face (a process similar to data compression)  thereby creating a representation that can be decoded to reconstruct the full face. The trick is to feed the encoded data for one face into the decoder for the other. The neural network will then conjure  often with surprising accuracy  one face mimicking the otherâ\\x80\\x99s expressions and movements. The resulting video can seem wonky  but OpenFaceSwap will automatically blur the edges and adjust the coloring of the newly transplanted face to make things look more genuine.\\nSimilar technology can be used to re-create someoneâ\\x80\\x99s voice  too. A startup called Lyrebird has posted convincing demos of Barack Obama and Donald Trump saying entirely made-up things. Lyrebird says that in the future it will limit its voice duplications to people who have given their permissionâ\\x80\\x94but surely not everyone will be so scrupulous.\\n\\nA startup has posted convincing demos of Barack Obama and Donald Trump saying entirely made-up things.\\n\\nThere are well-established methods for identifying doctored images and video. One option is to search the web for images that might have been mashed together. A more technical solution is to look for telltale changes to a digital file  or to the pixels in an image or a video frame. An expert can search for visual inconsistenciesâ\\x80\\x94a shadow that shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be there  or an object thatâ\\x80\\x99s the wrong size.\\n\\nDartmouth Universityâ\\x80\\x99s Hany Farid  one of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s foremost experts  has shown how a scene can be reconstructed in 3-D in order to discover physical oddities. He has also proved that subtle changes in pixel intensity in a video  indicating a personâ\\x80\\x99s pulse rate  can be used to spot the difference between a real person and a computer-generated one. Recently one of Faridâ\\x80\\x99s former students  now a professor at the State University of New York at Albany  has shown that irregular eye blinking can give away a face thatâ\\x80\\x99s been manipulated by AI.\\n\\nStill  most people canâ\\x80\\x99t do this kind of detective work and donâ\\x80\\x99t have time to study every image or clip that pops up on Facebook. So as visual fakery has become more common  thereâ\\x80\\x99s been a push to automate the analysis. And it turns out that not only does deep learning excel at making stuff up  itâ\\x80\\x99s ideal for scrutinizing images and videos for signs of fakery. This effort has only just begun  though  and it may ultimately be hindered by how realistic the automated fakes could become.\\n\\nNetworks of deception\\n\\nOne of the latest ideas in AI research involves turning neural networks against themselves in order to produce even more realistic fakes. A â\\x80\\x9cgenerative adversarial network â\\x80\\x9d or GAN  uses two deep neural networks: one thatâ\\x80\\x99s been trained to identify real images or video  and another that learns over time how to outwit its counterpart. GANs can be trained to produce surprisingly realistic fake imagery.\\n\\nBeyond copying and swapping faces  GANs may make it possible to synthesize entire scenes and people that look quite real  turning a daytime scene into a nighttime one and dreaming up imaginary celebrities. GANs donâ\\x80\\x99t work perfectly  but they are getting better all the time  and this is a hot area of research (MIT Technology Review named GANs one of its â\\x80\\x9c10 Breakthrough Technologiesâ\\x80\\x9d for 2018).\\n\\nGANs can turn daytime scenes into nighttime ones and dream up imaginary celebrity faces.\\n\\nMost worrying  the technique could also be used to evade digital forensics. The USâ\\x80\\x99s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency invited researchers to take part in a contest this summer in which some developed fake videos using GANs and others tried to detect them. â\\x80\\x9cGANs are a particular challenge to us in the forensics community because they can be turned against our forensic techniques â\\x80\\x9d says Farid. â\\x80\\x9cIt remains to be seen which side will prevail.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis is the end\\n\\nIf we arenâ\\x80\\x99t careful  this might result in the end of the worldâ\\x80\\x94or least what seems like it.\\n\\nIn April  a supposed BBC news report announced the opening salvos of a nuclear conflict between Russia and NATO. The clip  which began circulating on the messaging platform WhatsApp  showed footage of missiles blasting off as a newscaster told viewers that the German city of Mainz had been destroyed along with parts of Frankfurt.\\n\\nIt was  of course  entirely fake  and the BBC rushed to denounce it. The video wasnâ\\x80\\x99t generated using AI  but it showed the power of fake video  and how it can spread rumors at warp speed. The proliferation of AI programs will make such videos far easier to make  and even more convincing.\\n\\nEven if we arenâ\\x80\\x99t fooled by fake news  it might have dire consequences for political debate. Just as we are now accustomed to questioning whether a photograph might have been Photoshopped  AI-generated fakes could make us more suspicious about events we see shared online. And this could contribute to the further erosion of rational political debate.\\n\\nIn The Death of Truth  published this year  the literary critic Michiko Kakutani argues that alternative facts  fake news  and the general craziness of modern politics represent the culmination of cultural currents that stretch back decades. Kakutani sees hyperreal AI fakes as just the latest heavy blow to the concept of objective reality.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBefore the technology even gets good  the fact that it exists and is a way to erode confidence in legitimate material is deeply problematic â\\x80\\x9d says Renee DiResta  a researcher at Data for Democracy and one of the first people to identify the phenomenon of politically motivated Twitter misinformation campaigns.\\n\\nPerhaps the greatest risk with this new technology  then  is not that it will be misused by state hackers  political saboteurs  or Anonymous  but that it will further undermine truth and objectivity itself. If you canâ\\x80\\x99t tell a fake from reality  then it becomes easy to question the authenticity of anything. This already serves as a way for politicians to evade accountability.\\n\\nPerhaps the greatest risk is that the technology will further undermine truth and objectivity.\\n\\nPresident Trump has turned the idea of fake news upside down by using the term to attack any media reports that criticize his administration. He has also suggested that an incriminating clip of him denigrating women  released during the 2016 campaign  might have been digitally forged. This April  the Russian government accused Britain of faking video evidence of a chemical attack in Syria to justify proposed military action. Neither accusation was true  but the possibility of sophisticated fakery is increasingly diminishing the credibility of real information. In Myanmar and Russia new legislation seeks to prohibit fake news  but in both cases the laws may simply serve as a way to crack down on criticism of the government.\\n\\nAs the powerful become increasingly aware of AI fakery  it will become easy to dismiss even clear-cut video evidence of wrongdoing as nothing more than GAN-made digital deception.\\n\\nThe truth will still be out there. But will you know it when you see it?\\n\\nWill Knight is a senior editor at MIT Technology Review who covers artificial intelligence.\\n  A robotic system developed by the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory.

US Army More than 2 400 AI researchers recently signed a  pledge  promising not to build so-called autonomous weapons  systems that would decide on their own whom to kill. This follows Google  s decision not to renew a contract to supply the Pentagon with AI for analysis of drone footage after the company came under pressure from many employees opposed to its work on a project known as Maven. Paul Scharre  the author of a new book   Army of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War   believes that AI researchers need to do more than opt out if they want to bring about change. Paul Scharre. Win McNamee/Getty Images An Army Ranger in Iraq and Afghanistan and now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security  Scharre argues that AI experts should engage with policymakers and military professionals to explain why researchers are concerned and help them understand the  limitations of AI systems.\\n\\nScharre spoke with MITTechnology Review senior editor Will Knight about the best way to halt a potentially dangerous AI arms race.\\n\\nImage of Army of None book cover\\nPAULSCHARRE.COM\\nHow keen is the US military to develop AI weapons?\\n\\nUS defense leaders have repeatedly stated that their intention is to keep a human â\\x80\\x9cin the loopâ\\x80\\x9d and responsible for lethal-force decisions. Now  the caveat is theyâ\\x80\\x99ve also acknowledged that if other countries build autonomous weapons  then they may be forced to follow suit. And thatâ\\x80\\x99s the real riskâ\\x80\\x94that if one country crosses this line then others may feel they have to respond in kind just to remain competitive.\\n\\nCan these promises really be trusted  though?\\n\\nI think senior US defense officials are sincere that they want humans to remain responsible for the use of lethal force. Military professionals certainly donâ\\x80\\x99t want their weapons running amok. Having said that  it remains an open question how to translate a broad concept like human responsibility over lethal force into specific engineering guidance on what kinds of weapons are allowed. The definition of what constitutes an â\\x80\\x9cautonomous weaponâ\\x80\\x9d is contested already  so there may be differing views on how to put those principles into practice.\\n\\nWhy do technologists need to be involved?\\n\\nAI researchers must be a part of these conversations  as their technical expertise is vital to shaping policy choices. We need to take into account AI bias  transparency  explainability  safety  and other concerns. AI technology has these twin features todayâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s powerful but also has many vulnerabilities  much like computers and cyber risks. Unfortunately  governments seem to have gotten the first part of that message (AI is powerful) but not the second (it comes with risks). AI researchers can help governments and militaries better understand why they are so concerned about the consequences of weaponizing this technology. To make that case effectively  AI researchers need to be part of a constructive dialogue.\\n\\nWhat do you make of the recent pledge against autonomous weapons  organized by the Future of Life Institute?\\n\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s is not the first call to action by AI scientists; it builds on prior open letters on autonomous weapons in 2015 and 2017. But these letters are a symbolic gesture and probably have diminishing returns in their effectiveness. Countries have also been discussing autonomous weapons at the United Nations since 2014  and the pressure from AI scientists adds an important dimension to the conversation but has yet to sway major military powers to support a comprehensive ban. It would be more impactful to have more AI researchers attending the UN meetings and helping policymakers understand why AI scientists are so concerned.\\n\\nWhat about Googleâ\\x80\\x99s decision not to renew its contract with the Pentagon?\\n\\nIt was a bit surprising because Maven didnâ\\x80\\x99t actually involve autonomous weapons or targeting and appeared to be compliant with Googleâ\\x80\\x99s recently released AI principles. But the competition for top AI talent is fierce  and I suspect Google couldnâ\\x80\\x99t risk some of its best engineers resigning in protest.\\n\\nDo you think such gestures will help slow down the development of autonomous weapons?\\n\\nWhen it comes to Maven  Google wasnâ\\x80\\x99t involved in building even human-controlled weapons  much less autonomous weapons  so there isnâ\\x80\\x99t a direct connection there. The pledge letter is of course directly aimed at autonomous weapons. But I donâ\\x80\\x99t think either is likely to have a major effect on how militaries incorporate AI and autonomy into their weapons  since weapons are likely to be built by defense contractors. If major tech companies like Google opt out of working with militaries  then that could slow the incorporation of AI technology into vital support functions like data analysis  which Maven was doing. But eventually other companies will step in to fill the gap. Already  weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen othercompanies say quite publicly that they want to work with the military.\\n\\nCould these efforts have unintended consequences too?\\n\\nPainting many legitimate uses of AI as unacceptable could further drive a wedge between the technical and policy communities and make reasonable discourse harder. Engineers absolutely should refrain from working on projects they cannot support  but when those personal motivations shift to pressuring others from working on important and legitimate national security applications  they harm public safety and impinge on the rights of other engineers to pursue their own conscience. Democratic countries will need to use AI technology for a variety of important and lawful national security purposesâ\\x80\\x94intelligence  counterterrorism  border security  cybersecurity  and defense.\\n\\nIs the US already in an AI weapons arms race with China?\\n\\nChina has publicly declared its intention to become the global leader in artificial intelligence by 2030 and is increasing its research and recruiting top talent from around the globe. Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s model of military-civil fusion also means that AI research will readily flow from tech firms into the military without the kind of barriers that some Google employees aim to erect in the United States. China has already begun to lay the foundations for an AI-empowered techno-surveillance state.\\n\\nIf AI researchersâ\\x80\\x99 tactics only succeed in slowing the adoption of AI tools in open  democratic societies that value ethical behavior  their work could contribute to ushering in a future where the most powerful technology is in the hands of regimes who care the least about ethics and the rule of law.\\n\\nIn your book  you point out that defining autonomy can be tricky. Wonâ\\x80\\x99t this complicate the discussion over military uses of AI?\\n\\nThe authors of the recent pledge against autonomous weapons object to autonomous weapons that would kill a person but acknowledge that some kinds of autonomous systems would be needed to defend against other such weapons. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the gray area where autonomy might be needed to defend against weaponry and a person is still onboard  like in targeting a fighter jet or submarine  where the real challenge lies. Balancing competing objectives is not simple  and policymakers will face real choices as they adopt this technology.\\n\\nAI engineers will be most impactful in shaping these choices if they engage in a constructive  continuous dialogue with policymakers  rather than opting out. AI researchers who care about how the technology is used will be more effective if they move beyond pressure campaigns and start helping to educate policymakers about AI technology today and its limitations.  A deepfake of Nicolas Cage stitched onto Donald Trump. The eyes betray the deceit. SUNY Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning The Defense Department has produced the first tools for catching deepfakes Fake video clips made with artificial intelligence can also be spotted using AI  but this may be the beginning of an arms race. by     Will Knight Aug 7  2018 A deepfake of Nicolas Cage stitched onto Donald Trump. The eyes betray the deceit. SUNY The first forensics tools for catching revenge porn and fake news created with AI have been developed through a program run by the US Defense Department. Forensics experts have rushed to find ways of detecting videos synthesized and manipulated using machine learning because the technology makes it far easier to create convincing fake videos that could be used to sow disinformation or harass people. The most common technique for generating fake videos involves using machine learning to swap one person  s face onto another\\'s. The resulting videos  known as   deepfakes  are simple to make  and can be  surprisingly realistic . Further tweaks  made by a skilled video editor  can make them seem  even more real Video trickery involves using a machine-learning technique known as generative modeling  which lets a computer learn from real data before producing fake examples that are statistically similar. A recent twist on this involves having two neural networks  known as generative adversarial networks  work together to produce ever more convincing fakes (see â\\x80\\x9cThe GANfather: The man whoâ\\x80\\x99s given machines the gift of imaginationâ\\x80\\x9d).\\n\\nThe tools for catching deepfakes were developed through a programâ\\x80\\x94run by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)â\\x80\\x94called Media Forensics. The program was created to automate existing forensics tools  but has recently turned its attention to AI-made forgery.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve discovered subtle cues in current GAN-manipulated images and videos that allow us to detect the presence of alterations â\\x80\\x9d says Matthew Turek  who runs the Media Forensics program.\\nOne remarkably simple technique was developed by a team led by Siwei Lyu  a professor at the State University of New York at Albany    and one of his students. â\\x80\\x9cWe generated about 50 fake videos and tried a bunch of traditional forensics methods. They worked on and off  but not very well â\\x80\\x9d Lyu says.\\n\\nThen  one afternoon  while studying several deepfakes  Lyu realized that the faces made using deepfakes rarely  if ever  blink. And when they do blink  the eye-movement is unnatural. This is because deepfakes are trained on still images  which tend to show a person with his or her eyes open.\\n\\nOthers involved in the DARPA challenge are exploring similar tricks for automatically catching deepfakes: strange head movements  odd eye color  and so on. â\\x80\\x9cWe are working on exploiting these types of physiological signals that  for now at least  are difficult for deepfakes to mimic â\\x80\\x9d says Hany Farid  a leading digital forensics expert at Dartmouth College.\\n\\nDARPAâ\\x80\\x99s Turek says the agency will run more contests â\\x80\\x9cto ensure the technologies in development are able to detect the latest techniques.\"\\n\\nThe arrival of these forensics tools may simply signal the beginning of an AI-powered arms race between video forgers and digital sleuths. A key problem  says Farid  is that machine-learning systems can be trained to outmaneuver forensics tools.\\n\\nLyu says a skilled forger could get around his eye-blinking tool simply by collecting images that show a person blinking. But he adds that his team has developed an even more effective technique  but says heâ\\x80\\x99s keeping it secret for the moment. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d rather hold off at least for a little bit â\\x80\\x9d Lyu says. â\\x80\\x9cWe have a little advantage over the forgers right now  and we want to keep that advantage.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n   Artificial Intelligence Jul 31  2018 Democrats call for a review of face recognition tech US lawmakers  have asked  the Government Accountability Office to examine how face recognition technology is being used by companies and law enforcement agencies. The questioners:  A group of Democrats from both the House of Representatives and the Senate sent a letter to the GAO asking to examine which agencies are using the technology  and what safeguards the industry has in place. Some form of government regulation could eventually be imposed. Eye spies:  There is growing concern that unfettered use of facial recognition could enable greater government surveillance and automate discrimination. Some companies also appear concerned. Microsoft  s general counsel  Brad Smith   recently called  for the tech to be regulated. Oh  (big) brother:  The ACLU recently trained Amazon  s Rekognition technology on a public data set of criminal mugshots  and  found that it incorrectly identified  28 lawmakers as law breakers. Amazon maintains that the system was used incorrectly. Bias baked in:  A  study published this year  by  Joy Buolamwini   a researcher at MIT  and  Timnit Gebru   a postdoc at Microsoft  showed that the face recognition services offered by IBM and Microsoft were better able to recognize white men than women or minorities. Share  Artificial Intelligence Jul 26  2018 Lawmakers will look more closely at facial-recognition software after being mistaken for criminals The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) came up with a clever way to draw lawmakers   attention to the limitations of facial-recognition technology: it used it to (falsely) identify more than 28 of them as criminals. Lawmakers or breakers?:  The  ACLU used Amazon  s Rekognition platform  to compare federal lawmakers   faces with 25 000 publically available mugshots. They found that 28 members of Congress matched incorrectly with known criminals.  Rekognition  is currently being used by a number of US police departments. In its defense   Amazon says  law enforcement should only use the technology to   narrow the field. Err  Jeff?  The incident may encourage lawmakers to take a closer look at technology that has significant privacy implications. Three of the US lawmakers erroneously identified  have written a letter  asking Amazon to explain how its system works. Two more have  asked for meeting  with Amazon  s CEO  Jeff Bezos  to discuss the issue. Troubling bias:  Amazon  s software disproportionately identified African-American and Latino lawmakers. Racial bias has been  found in other  commercial face-recognition systems.

Artificial Intelligence  /  Voice Assistants How to tell if you  re talking to a bot The five best ways to detect fake social-media accounts. by     Will Knight Jul 18  2018 Twitter recently took drastic action as part of an effort to slow the spread of misinformation through its platform   shutting down  more than two million automated accounts  or bots. But Twitter shuttered only the most egregious  and obvious  offenders. You can expect the tricksters to up their game when it comes to disguising fake users as real ones. It  s important not to be swayed by fake accounts or waste your time arguing with them  and identifying bots in a Twitter thread has become a strange version of the Turing test. Accusing posters of being bots has even become an oddly satisfying way to insult their intelligence. Advances in machine learning hint at how bots could become more humanlike. IBM researchers recently  demonstrated a system  capable of conjuring up a reasonably coherent argument by mining text. And  Google  s Duplex software  also shows how AI systems can learn to mimic the nuances of human conversation. But technology might also provide a solution. In 2015 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ran  a contest on Twitter bot detection . Participants trained their systems to identify fake accounts using five key data points. The resulting systems are far from perfect (the best worked about 40 percent of the time)  but the efforts reveal how best to spot a bot on Twitter. We may come to rely on these signals much more. User profile The most common way to tell if an account is fake is to check out the profile. The most rudimentary bots lack a photo  a link  or any bio. More sophisticated ones might use a photo stolen from the web  or an automatically generated account name. Tweet syntax Using human language is still incredibly hard for machines. A bot  s tweets may reveal its algorithmic logic: they may be formulaic or repetitive  or use responses common in chatbot programs. Missing an obvious joke and rapidly changing the subject are other telltale traits (unfortunately  they are also quite common among human Twitter users). Tweet semantics Bots are usually created with a particular end in mind  so they may be overly obsessed with a particular topic  perhaps reposting the same link again and again or tweeting about little else. Temporal behavior Looking at tweets over time can also be revealing. If an account tweets at an impossible rate  at unlikely times  or even too regularly  that can be a good sign that it  s fake. Researchers also found that fake accounts often betray an inconsistent attitude toward topics over time. Network features Network dynamics aren  t visible to most users  but they can reveal a lot about an account. Bots may follow only a few accounts or be followed by many other bots. The tone of a bot  s tweets may also be incongruous with those of its connections  suggesting a lack of any real social interaction. Share Link Tagged Tech Policy    AI Ethics Author Will Knight Popular 0  Future of Work Jul 17  2018 A new report says AI will replace as many jobs as it kills  but take that with a huge grain of salt The consulting firm PwC  anticipates  that artificial intelligence will add as many jobs to the UK economy as are lost because of the technology. The predictions:  The paper forecasts that about 20 percent of UK jobs will be automated by 2037  but 20 percent more jobs will also be created. Strictly speaking  the report suggests about 7 million will be lost and 7.2 million gained  but with all the uncertainties in these predictions  that 0.2 million difference is virtually negligible. What AI taketh away ...  PwC hypothesizes that manufacturing sector jobs could be reduced by around 25 percent  a net loss of nearly 700 000 jobs. ... it also giveth back:  On the other hand  the health and social work sector will see nearly a million new jobs created thanks to AI. But   Take results like this with a big grain of salt. Job predictions that look nearly 20 years into the future make a lot of assumptions. As  the authors write     Our central estimate is that the net effect of AI on jobs will be broadly neutral  but there are many uncertain factors that could tip the balance towards more optimistic or pessimistic scenarios. The takeaway:  Companies  researchers  and consultancy groups  disagree like crazy  over how many jobs and job functions will succumb to automation. Reports from reputable groups can help predict general trends  but instead of seeking out specific numbers related to technology-induced job loss  we need to  figure out how to deal with it .

A view from the top:  Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith wrote in  a blog post  Friday that the company is asking Congress to regulate AI-powered face recognition software.   There will always be debates about the details  and the details matter greatly  Smith wrote.   But a world with vigorous regulation of products that are useful but potentially troubling is better than a world devoid of legal standards. What should they regulate?  Smith outlined questions he thinks officials should discuss including:      -  Should law enforcement  s use of facial recognition be subject to human oversight and controls?      -  What types of legal measures can prevent use of facial recognition for racial profiling and other violations of rights  while still permitting beneficial uses of the technology?      -  Should the government create processes that afford legal rights to individuals who believe they have been misidentified by a facial recognition system? Why this matters:  The tech industry is known for avoiding government intervention   not encouraging it . The call shows Microsoft  s hope to avoid being lumped in with some of its counterparts  which have faced major privacy scandals in recent months.

And that was how I found myself introduced to Google  s latest AI masterpiece  the conversation-filler-injecting  Turing test contender  known as Duplex. When Google rolls it out to some users for testing in the coming weeks  Duplex will be a tool within the Google Assistant app that the testers can use to call stores on their behalf and find out their holiday hours. Later this summer  it will also be able to call restaurants and salons to set up reservations and hair appointments. It was  unveiled in May  at the company  s annual developer conference to much fanfare and  in the days later  much fuss. After its impressive demo   people expressed concerns  about how human it sounded (complete with â\\x80\\x9cumâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cahâ\\x80\\x9d sounds) and how  in its onstage example  it didnâ\\x80\\x99t identify itself as an artificial-intelligence agent.\\n\\nSince then Google has tried to assuage fears. As the ethical criticisms multiplied in the days after the demo  the company quickly said that Duplex will announce itself as an AI agent to the human itâ\\x80\\x99s calling and state that the call will be recorded.\\n\\nAnd on Tuesday Google invited a bunch of reporters to the normally bustling Orenâ\\x80\\x99s Hummus Shop in downtown Mountain View  California  to show off Duplexâ\\x80\\x99s progress. While would-be customers were denied hummus outside  members of Googleâ\\x80\\x99s Assistant team showed reporters how the system will work and let us try it for ourselves inside the restaurant.\\n\\nOne big change from last monthâ\\x80\\x99s Duplex demonstration is that the calls I heard (and one I answered) clearly came from an AI agent. In the call I picked up while posing as a restaurant hostess  a female-sounding voice quickly said it was an automated service that was recording the call (this video from Google gives an idea of how it will look and sound; I was able to record audio for note-taking purposes  but Google asked me not to share it as a condition of attending the demonstration).\\n\\nNick Fox  vice president of product and design for Google Assistant  said Google knew back in May that it needed to disclose that the calls were coming from AI  and that this need was â\\x80\\x9cvalidatedâ\\x80\\x9d after the unveiling at the developer conference.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t say we necessarily changed anything based on the feedback â\\x80\\x9d he said. He said the company gave the original demo without that notification because at the time it was trying to display the technology rather than a complete product.\\n\\nDuring my call  I tried to give the voice on the other end a hard timeâ\\x80\\x94pretending I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t hear details like the date on which the AI wanted a tableâ\\x80\\x94just to see what would happen. Would it loop in a human operator? (Google says this still happens in one out of five Duplex test calls  though it wouldn\\'t say much else about these helpers.) Would it simply hang up if I confused it too much? (This didnâ\\x80\\x99t happen to me  but it did to another reporter  who told the AI that the kitchen at the fictitious restaurant would be closed after a certain time and only the bar menu would be available.)\\n\\nOverall  Duplex did what it was supposed to. It repeated itself when I asked it to. It didnâ\\x80\\x99t get fazed when I asked it to hold  and it didnâ\\x80\\x99t get tripped up when I stumbled over my own words. When I said I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t take a reservation for five people on Sunday until 8 p.m.  rather than the requested time of 6  it was still willing to make the reservation.\\n\\nI was impressed by the humanness of its voice; it did sound like a person (though during one sample call I heard it sounded distinctly computerized when speaking a phone number).\\n\\nScott Huffman  vice president of engineering for Google Assistant  played our assembled group a recording of an early version of Duplexâ\\x80\\x94a stilted  British-accented male voice that was unmistakably computerizedâ\\x80\\x94and said that this kind of non-human-sounding voice didnâ\\x80\\x99t work with businesses. Lots of people would hang up the phone  and reservations werenâ\\x80\\x99t completed  he said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPeople didnâ\\x80\\x99t deal well with how unnatural it sounded â\\x80\\x9d he said. Apparently  things improved a lot as the AI was made to sound more like a person.\\n\\nWhile â\\x80\\x9cumâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cahâ\\x80\\x9d sounds coming from an aural AI might freak you out  Huffman said those programmed verbal tics are meant to move conversations along smoothly.

When I asked if there would be kids in the group  and if a high chair would be needed  the female voice said it was making the reservation on behalf of a client and didnâ\\x80\\x99t know (another reporter asked a similar question and got the same kind of answer).\\n\\nAnd when I asked if there would be any accessibility needsâ\\x80\\x94such as if anyone in the group used a wheelchairâ\\x80\\x94it couldnâ\\x80\\x99t give me an answer either.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t really know  sorry â\\x80\\x9d the voice said.\\n\\nWhen Duplex is deployed  there will still be limitations  and no chance for a real conversation.

IYIKON/anbileru adaleru/yaroslav samoylov/SBTS/Hea Pon Lin (The Noun Project) Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics Don  t be AI-vil: Google says its algorithms will do no harm Google has created a set of principles for its artificial-intelligence researchers to live by  and they prohibit weapons technology. by     Will Knight Jun 7  2018 IYIKON/anbileru adaleru/yaroslav samoylov/SBTS/Hea Pon Lin (The Noun Project) Google has created an artificial-intelligence code of ethics that prohibits the development of autonomous weapons. But the principles leave sufficient wiggle room for Google to benefit from lucrative defense deals down the line. The announcement comes in the wake of significant internal protest over the use of Google  s AI technology by a Department of Defense initiative called the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team. The goal of this venture  known internally as  Project Maven   is to improve the accuracy of drone strikes  among other things. Last month a dozen Google workers quit over the scandal  and many more signed an open letter of protest. The uproar captures the fears many have about how technology might help automate warfare in the future. The situation is not simple  however. Artificial intelligence could help make some weapons systems safer and less error prone. There are also many mundane applications of AI across the defense industry. Google doesn  t want to disavow this huge potential market for its cloud AI technology. Google  s CEO  Sundar Pichai  announced the new code in a blog post today. It suggests seven principles for guiding Google  s use of AI  stating that it should benefit society; avoid algorithmic bias; respect privacy; be tested for safety; be accountable to the public; maintain scientific rigor; and be made available to others in accordance with the same principles. But Pichai also took pains to state that Google would not allow its AI technology to be used to develop anything that could cause harm  including   weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people. Pichai said Google would also avoid developing surveillance technology that violates internationally accepted norms on human rights  or any technology that contravenes international laws. Artificial intelligence is developing quickly  and Google has run into other problems involving AI projects. One of its computer vision systems  for example  repeatedly misidentified people of African heritage as gorillas. The company abandoned its   Don  t be evil motto this April  but it retains an idealistic culture. Military uses of artificial intelligence could be increasingly contentious as the technology is adopted in new ways and companies seek to sell their cloud AI technology as widely as possible. Machine learning and artificial intelligence will inevitably become more important for intelligence and defense work. Other US tech companies  including Amazon and Microsoft  have bid on a multibillion-dollar cloud computing project with the Pentagon.

The contract  part of a Pentagon effort known as Project Maven  sparked a  storm of internal unrest and media controversy  over Google  s apparent role in weaponizing the use of AI. Targets acquired:  As first  reported  by  Gizmodo   Google has been supplying technology and know-how to the US military for automating the analysis of drone footage. Defense is a huge potential market  but many Google employees were appalled that the company might be helping develop tech that could lead to automated drone strikes. The war within:  The head of Google  s cloud business  Diane Greene   reportedly  told staff this week that the company would not seek a new contract after it expires.  Previously leaked e-mails  show that some AI experts within Google also objected to the program and anticipated the media fallout. Booming business:  This is far from the end of the story. Artificial intelligence will be a key asset in warfare going forward  and other big tech companies are pursuing military AI contracts. As  Wired  recently pointed out  Project Maven is poised to expand  with or without Google.

Background:  After Facebook rolled out its live video feature in 2016  the company was criticized for a rash of suicides streamed to audiences on the platform. In response  the company created AI tools to spot dangerous behavior and increased the number of reviewers  so that it took less than 10 minutes to remove footage after it was posted. Improvement:  Investing in  chips with AI software  that can recognize self-harm  sexual acts  or other activities Facebook wants to ban would reduce the need for human moderators to watch suspect videos. Why it matters:  Mark Zuckerberg has  big plans for these kinds of custom-built systems . By designing and making its own hardware  Facebook could not only improve its platform but save a lot of money by reducing reliance on chip manufacturers like Nvidia and Intel.

Ethical Tech May 9  2018 This company audits algorithms to see how biased they are Mathematician Cathy O  Neil is offering businesses a chance  to test their algorithms for fairness . Opening the black box:  As artificial-intelligence systems get more advanced  the logic paths they follow can be difficult or even impossible to understand   creating a so-called   black box.  As these algorithms come to control increasingly important parts of our lives  like  whether we get a job  or a loan   it is crucial to understand their biases and decisions . The solution:  O  Neil  who wrote the book  Weapons of Math Destruction    has started   O  Neil Risk Consulting and Algorithmic Auditing  to perform third-party audits on algorithms. It examines everything from the people who programmed the software to the training data to the output  flagging any bias in the process. Why would businesses choose to do this?  Companies aren  t knocking down her door yet (she has only six clients). But they should be: not only is it in society  s best interest  it  s also good marketing. Getting a your algorithm certified for fairness can prove to your customers that your service is equitable  effective  and trustworthy.

Cold war freeze:  According to the  New York Times   the Trump administration is considering broad new visa rules that could make it a lot harder for Chinese nationals to work on a range of technologies  including artificial intelligence  which is  increasingly seen as a military asset . It unclear if this would prevent espionage  but it would certainly make it more difficult for US universities and companies to develop cutting-edge technology. Upping the ante:  The discussions are the latest step in President Donald Trump  s escalating feud with China  which appears to be inspired as much by the country  s rising technological prowess as by its trade practices and growing military might. Trump has threatened tariffs on around $150 billion worth of Chinese goods  and Chinese investments in American technology companies are increasingly being blocked. Bound to backfire:  The Trump administration has  already introduced measures that have restricted the flow of top researchers into the US. The latest plan would only benefit China  which is already doing its best to keep its top talent at home.  Ethical Tech Apr 24  2018 Why artificial intelligence might trigger a nuclear war Well before Terminator robots rise and attack us  AI could help us destroy ourselves with nuclear weapons  warns a new study.   The news:  A  RAND Corporation report  concludes that military adoption of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies could have a destabilizing effect over the next couple of decades and lead some nation to take the nuclear option.  Details:  Strategic stability provided by   mutually assured destruction might be undermined if AI offers a new  and vastly better  way to target an adversary  s weapons systems  the report says. The findings are drawn from information collected through workshops with experts on nuclear weapons  national security  government policy  and AI.   Algorithms for peace:  It isn  t all doom and gloom. The study also suggests that under some scenarios  AI could help preserve strategic stability by providing new ways of gathering and analyzing information about nuclear capabilities.    A Strangelove scenario?  It is notoriously difficult to predict what AI will look like 10 or 20 years from now. That said  even current AI  looks likely to have a big impact on the military . The RAND report may only heighten calls to weaponize the technology and make its development a national priority.

Here are the highlights. Keep calm and make AI ethical:  The  report  outlines five core principles to guide the ethical use of AI. They are: 1.  Artificial intelligence should be developed for the common good and benefit of humanity. 2.  Artificial intelligence should operate on principles of intelligibility and fairness. 3.  Artificial intelligence should not be used to diminish the data rights or privacy of individuals  families  or communities. 4.  All citizens should have the right to be educated to enable them to flourish mentally  emotionally  and economically alongside artificial intelligence. 5.  The autonomous power to hurt  destroy  or deceive human beings should never be vested in artificial intelligence Regulators must step in:  The committee stops short of saying that specialist AI watchdogs should be created to police its guidelines. But it does hope that regulators will use them as a framework to themselves govern organizations that make use of machine learning. Stop data monopolies:    Large companies which have control over vast quantities of data must be prevented from becoming overly powerful  says the report  adding that users should have greater control of their data than they do at the moment. ( Did someone mention Facebook ?) Plus:  The report offers up a series of conclusions that will be familiar to people interested in the future of AI. It suggests that  among other things  the nation should invest in machine learning skills  workers whose jobs may be automated should be retrained  algorithms should be built so they don  t contain bias  and anyone using AI should do so with transparency.

In reference to China and Russia  he added    I think our adversaries  and they are our adversaries  understand very well the possible future utility of machine learning  and I think it  s time we did as well. Blurred battle lines:  Many AI researchers are already worried about military use of the technology. Google employees recently  signed an open letter  of protest to their CEO after the company  s involvement in a US DoD drone program  was revealed . It could prove hard for companies to resist lucrative military contracts  however. It seems inevitable that AI will be used for everything from data gathering and analysis to developing more sophisticated autonomous systems. So far  the US government has been  slow to embrace the technology   but  recently proposed legislation  could help change that  and it emphasizes military applications.

On Tuesday at  MIT Technology Review   s annual EmTech Digital conference in San Francisco  the cofounder of  Fast.ai   a company that offers free classes on deep learning  argued that AI is not as inaccessible as it seems. In an onstage presentation  Thomas discussed what are stereotypically considered prerequisites to working in AI  like a PhD  big data sets  and access to expensive computing power. She then gave examples of AI systems that defy those expectations  like a neural network one of her students created using a training technique that needed only 30 data points to work. She also pointed out the availability of a cloud-based GPU that cost just 45 cents an hour.   The barriers to using AI are lower than you may think  she said. Diverse viewpoints are essential to creating AI that tackles problems outside the purview of Silicon Valley. Thomas recounted the example of a farmer signing up for Fast.ai  s class to develop an algorithm to better monitor the health of his goats   udders.   You know about problems no one else knows about  she says. Thomas believes that having more diversity within the AI world will also help with the problems of bias and fairness that currently bedevil the industry. She thinks that more diverse teams can prevent problems like the tendency of Google  s Photos app to label  black people as   gorillas  and the implied racism uncovered by  ProPublica  in an algorithm being used for bail decisions in Florida.

Robots are increasingly becoming dependable coworkers and service providers  as two speakers at this year  s EmTech Digital conference demonstrate. by     Jackie Snow Mar 26  2018 Jeremy Portje Robots are increasingly  able to do more things  at human-like levels  but we are   so  so far away from the point where most will have the skills necessary to replace human workers  says Martin Hitch  chief business officer at  Bossa Nova . Instead  there are simple  boring tasks that robots can automate. Hitch  speaking today at  MIT Technology Review   s annual EmTech Digital conference in San Francisco  explained how Bossa Nova  s robots went from working in one Walmart location in rural Pennsylvania to roaming the aisles in 50 of the cavernous stores from California to Arkansas. The robots scan the shelves and then send information to the cloud  which gets passed on to the individual store within a few minutes. This includes information about what  s missing on the shelves or any item that might be displaying the incorrect price  saving a sales associate from having to walk around and scan each item manually.   At the end of the day  we are solving simple problems  Hitch said. They might be simple problems  but Bossa Nova has some serious data. To date  the company  s robots have done 6 320 hours of autonomous navigation  traveled 3 600 kilometers  scanned 117 000 aisles  and processed 395 000 000 images. In the long term  Hitch and Bossa Nova still face challenges  for instance  how to to scale up and how to avoid obstacles  like temporary in-store promotional displays or liquid that  s been spilled on the floor. There  s also the question of how to ensure that the robots   interactions with people go smoothly. Hitch says that at first  some store employees are more reluctant than others to accept that the robots don  t pose any physical danger. Eventually  though  human workers warm up to their mechanical coworkers and often give the robots names  like Megan or Eric Jr. Robots are also learning to solve issues that are less simple  like the  last-mile problem . Rui Li    Ã©the CEO and cofounder of Robby Technologies  showed off a video of his company  s new Robby 2.0  a cooler-size robot on wheels that can deliver up to   70 liters of booze (or any other order of that size). The robots say   Excuse me when blocked by pedestrians  and   Thank you if the people move. Li says besides making the robots polite  the researchers also trained them to stick to one side of the sidewalk  which helped let humans know how to interact with them.   This simple change in the behavior of the robot has solved a big problem  Li said. Robby 2.0 is also equipped for less friendly human interactions: an alarm goes off if anyone tries to pry open the robot  and a camera can be turned on for remote viewers to see what is going on. While the technology is still developing  Li promises that autonomous vehicles  from Robby 2.0 to drones to cars  will deliver 80 percent of all items in the future. But the trickiest foe these robots face while out in the world could be the most difficult to predict: teenagers. Hitch says teen shoppers have been known to kick the robots in Walmart  or even slam into them with a shopping cart. Once robots like Bossa Nova  s and Robby Technologies   become less of a novelty  that sort of reaction could go away. Until then  Hitch says  there is an easy solution that doesn  t rely on teaching teenagers not to sabotage robots.   You design for it  he says.

The news:  A video released by the Tempe  Arizona  police department shows what happened moments before one of Uber  s autonomous cars  killed a pedestrian on Sunday . The driver was recorded by a camera inside the car  looking down (perhaps at her phone) for several seconds. Gut-wrenchingly  she looks up at the last moment to see someone walking into the car  s path. What it means:  Her distraction is  in fact  an indictment of the car  s technology. Experts have long warned that  partial autonomy lulls people into a false sense of security   causing them to become dangerously disengaged. It can take many seconds for a person to regain situational awareness if something goes wrong. Sensor questions:  What remains unclear is why the sensors aboard Uber  s vehicle failed to spot the pedestrian  who was wheeling her bike across the road. Although the scene is dark  the lidar on the vehicle should have spotted the pedestrian easily. Investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board may uncover any problems with the car. Why it matters:  Companies rushing to commercialize vehicle automation are testing experimental systems on public roads. Moving too quickly could put lives at risk and set back a technology that could ultimately help reduce the number of people killed and injured on the roads each year.

The accident may prove to be a defining moment for the autonomous-car industry. More details:  The accident happened last night when a woman walked into the road in front of a vehicle traveling in self-driving mode. Uber says a safety driver was behind the wheel but no passengers were in the car. It isn  t clear yet whether the car  s self-driving system could have avoided the accident. Uber says it is cooperating with the investigation. What it means:  Experts have long worried that a negative public reaction to the first serious accidents involving self-driving vehicles could cool enthusiasm for the technology and lead to onerous regulations. Past accidents:  This is the first time a self-driving car has killed a pedestrian. But there have been accidents involving semi-automated systems. Most prominently  the driver of a Tesla Model S  was killed in May 2016  when his car crashed into a truck while driving in Autopilot mode.

Legal scholars are furiously debating which laws should apply to AI crime. by     Emerging Technology from the arXiv Mar 12  2018 Here  s a curious question: Imagine it is the year 2023 and self-driving cars are finally navigating our city streets. For the first time one of them has hit and killed a pedestrian  with huge media coverage. A high-profile lawsuit is likely  but what laws should apply? Today  we get an answer of sorts thanks to the work of John Kingston at the University of Brighton in the UK  who maps out the landscape in this incipient legal field. His analysis raises some important issues that the automotive  computing  and legal worlds should be wrestling with in earnest  if they are not already. At the heart of this debate is whether an AI system could be held criminally liable for its actions. Kingston says that Gabriel Hallevy at Ono Academic College in Israel has explored this issue in detail. Criminal liability usually requires an action and a mental intent (in legalese an  actus rea  and  mens rea ). Kingston says Hallevy explores three scenarios that could apply to AI systems. The first  known as  perpetrator via another   applies when an offense has been committed by a mentally deficient person or animal  who is therefore deemed to be innocent. But anybody who has instructed the mentally deficient person or animal can be held criminally liable. For example  a dog owner who instructed the animal to attack another individual.   That has implications for those designing intelligent machines and those who use them.   An AI program could be held to be an innocent agent  with either the software programmer or the user being held to be the perpetrator-via-another  says Kingston. The second scenario  known as  natural probable consequence   occurs when the ordinary actions of an AI system might be used inappropriately to perform a criminal act. Kingston gives the example of an artificially intelligent robot in a Japanese motorcycle factory that killed a human worker.   The robot erroneously identified the employee as a threat to its mission  and calculated that the most efficient way to eliminate this threat was by pushing him into an adjacent operating machine  says Kingston.   Using its very powerful hydraulic arm  the robot smashed the surprised worker into the machine  killing him instantly  and then resumed its duties. The key question here is whether the programmer of the machine knew that this outcome was a probable consequence of its use.   The third scenario is  direct liability   and this requires both an action and an intent. An action is straightforward to prove if the AI system takes an action that results in a criminal act or fails to take an action when there is a duty to act. The intent is much harder to determine but is still relevant  says Kingston.   Speeding is a strict liability offense  he says.   So according to Hallevy  if a self-driving car was found to be breaking the speed limit for the road it is on  the law may well assign criminal liability to the AI program that was driving the car at that time. In that case  the owner may not be liable. Then there is the issue of defense. If an AI system can be criminally liable  what defense might it use? Kingston raises a number of possibilities: Could a program that is malfunctioning claim a defense similar to the human defense of insanity? Could an AI infected by an electronic virus claim defenses similar to coercion or intoxication? These kinds of defenses are by no means theoretical. Kingston highlights a number of cases in the UK where people charged with computer-related offenses have successfully argued that their machines had been infected with malware that was instead responsible for the crime. In one case  a teenage computer hacker  charged with executing a denial-of-service attack  claimed that a Trojan program was instead responsible and had then wiped itself from the computer before it was forensically analyzed.   The defendant  s lawyer successfully convinced the jury that such a scenario was not beyond reasonable doubt  says Kingston. Finally  there is the issue of punishment. Who or what would be punished for an offense for which an AI system was directly liable  and what form would this punishment take? For the moment  there are no answers to these questions. But criminal liability may not apply  in which case the matter would have to be settled with civil law. Then a crucial question will be whether an AI system is a service or a product. If it is a product  then product design legislation would apply based on a warranty  for example. If it is a service  then the tort of negligence applies. In this case  the plaintiff would usually have to demonstrate three elements to prove negligence. The first is that the defendant had a duty of care  usually straightforward to show  although the standard of care might be difficult to assess in the case of an AI  says Kingston. The second element is that the defendant breached that duty. And the third is that the breach caused an injury to the plaintiff. And if all this weren  t murky enough  the legal standing of AI systems could change as their capabilities become more human-like and perhaps even superhuman. One thing is for sure: in the coming years  there is likely to be some fun to be had with all this by the lawyers  or the AI systems that replace them.

Safiya Umoja Noble came face to face with that fact one day when she used Google  s search engine to look for subjects her nieces might find interesting. She entered the term   black girls and came back with pages dominated by pornography.  Noble  a USC Annenberg communications professor  was horrified but not surprised. For years she has been arguing that the values of the web reflect its builders  mostly white  Western men  and do not represent minorities and women. Her latest book   Algorithms of Oppression   details research she started after that fateful Google search  and it explores the hidden structures that shape how we get information through the internet. The book  out this month  argues that search engine algorithms aren  t as neutral as Google would like you to think. Algorithms promote some results above others  and even a seemingly neutral piece of code can reflect society  s biases. What  s more  without any insight into how the algorithms work or what the broader context is  searches can unfairly shape the discussion of a topic like black girls.

Is there a better approach? \\n\\nWe could think about pulling back on such an ambitious project of organizing all the worldâ\\x80\\x99s knowledge  or we could reframe and say  â\\x80\\x9cThis is a technology that is imperfect.

Weâ\\x80\\x99re going to make those kinds of dimensions of our product more transparent so that you know the deeply subjective nature of the output.â\\x80\\x9d Instead  the position for many companiesâ\\x80\\x94not just Googleâ\\x80\\x94is that [they are] providing something that you can trust  and that you can count on  and this is where it becomes quite difficult.\\n\\nHow might machine learning perpetuate some of the racism and sexism you write about?\\n\\nI\\'ve been arguing that artificial intelligence  or automated decision-making systems  will become a human rights issue this century. I strongly believe that  because machine-learning algorithms and projects are using data that is already biased  incomplete  flawed  and [we are] teaching machines how to make decisions based on that information. We know [thatâ\\x80\\x99s] going to lead to a variety of disparate outcomes. Let me just add that AI will be harder and harder to intervene upon because it will become less clear what data has been used to inform the making of that AI  or the making of those systems. There are many different kinds of data sets  for example  that are not standardized  that are coalescing to make decisions.\\n\\nSince you first searched for â\\x80\\x9cblack girlsâ\\x80\\x9d in 2010  have you seen things get better or worse?\\n\\nSince I started writing about and speaking publicly about black girls in particular being associated with pornography  things have changed.

But other communities  like Latina and Asian girls  are still highly sexualized in search results.

That  s a problem for all of us. by     Jackie Snow Feb 14  2018 courtesy of timnit gebru Artificial intelligence is an increasingly seamless part of our everyday lives  present in everything from web searches to social media to home assistants like Alexa. But what do we do if this massively important technology is unintentionally  but fundamentally  biased? And what do we do if this massively important field includes almost no black researchers? Timnit Gebru is tackling these questions as part of Microsoft  s Fairness  Accountability  Transparency  and Ethics in AI group  which she joined last summer. She also cofounded the Black in AI event at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) conference in 2017 and was on the steering committee for the first Fairness and Transparency conference in February. She spoke with  MIT Technology Review  about how bias gets into AI systems and how diversity can counteract it. This story is part of our     March/April 2018     issue See the rest of the issue How does the lack of diversity distort artificial intelligence and specifically computer vision?\\n\\nI can talk about this for a whole year. There is a bias to what kinds of problems we think are important  what kinds of research we think are important  and where we think AI should go. If we donâ\\x80\\x99t have diversity in our set of researchers  we are not going to address problems that are faced by the majority of people in the world. When problems donâ\\x80\\x99t affect us  we donâ\\x80\\x99t think theyâ\\x80\\x99re that important  and we might not even know what these problems are  because weâ\\x80\\x99re not interacting with the people who are experiencing them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I started Black in AI  I started it with a couple of my friends. I had a tiny mailing list before that where I literally would add any black person I saw in this field into the mailing list and be like  â\\x80\\x98Hi  Iâ\\x80\\x99m Timnit. Iâ\\x80\\x99m black person number two. Hi  black person number one. Letâ\\x80\\x99s be friends.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAre there ways to counteract bias in systems?\\n\\nThe reason diversity is really important in AI  not just in data sets but also in researchers  is that you need people who just have this social sense of how things are. We are in a diversity crisis for AI. In addition to having technical conversations  conversations about law  conversations about ethics  we need to have conversations about diversity in AI. We need all sorts of diversity in AI. And this needs to be treated as something thatâ\\x80\\x99s extremely urgent.\\n\\nFrom a technical standpoint  there are many different kinds of approaches. One is to diversify your data set and to have many different annotations of your data set  like race and gender and age. Once you train a model  you can test it out and see how well it does by all these different subgroups. But even after you do this  you are bound to have some sort of bias in your data set. You cannot have a data set that perfectly samples the whole world.\\n\\nSomething Iâ\\x80\\x99m really passionate about and Iâ\\x80\\x99m working on right now is to figure out how to encourage companies to give more information to users or even researchers. They should have recommended usage  what the pitfalls are  how biased the data set is  etc. So that when Iâ\\x80\\x99m a startup and Iâ\\x80\\x99m just taking your off-the-shelf data set or off-the-shelf model and incorporating it into whatever Iâ\\x80\\x99m doing  at least I have some knowledge of what kinds of pitfalls there may be. Right now weâ\\x80\\x99re in a place almost like the Wild West  where we donâ\\x80\\x99t really have many standards [about] where we put out data sets.\\n\\nAnd then there are just some things you probably shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be using machine learning for right now  and we donâ\\x80\\x99t have a clear guideline for what those things are. We should say that if youâ\\x80\\x99re going to use machine learning for this particular task  the accuracy of your model should be at least X  and it should be fair in this particular respect. We donâ\\x80\\x99t have any sort of guidelines for that either. AI is just now starting to be baked into the mainstream  into a product everywhere  so weâ\\x80\\x99re at a precipice where we really need some sort of conversation around standardization and usage.\\nWhatâ\\x80\\x99s been the driving motivation behind your work with Google Street View and other demographic research?\\n\\nAt the time we started this project  there was very little work being done to try to analyze culture using images. But we know that online  most of our data is in the form of images. One of our motivations was to show that you could do social analyses using images.\\n\\nThis could be very useful in cases where getting survey-based data is really hard. There are places in the world where the infrastructure is not there and the resources are not there to send people door to door and gather [census] data  [but where] having an understanding of the different types of populations that live in your country would be very helpful.\\n\\nBut then again  this is exactly the thing that also made me want to study fairness. Because if Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be continuing to do this line of work  I really need to have a better understanding of the potentially negative repercussions. What are the repercussions for surveillance? Also  what are the repercussions for a data-set bias? In any sort of data-mining project  youâ\\x80\\x99re going to have a bias. So my line of work there was really what led me to want to spend some time in the fairness community to understand where the pitfalls could be.\\n\\nWhat issues are you hoping to address with this first Fairness and Transparency conference?\\n\\nThis is really the first conference that is addressing the issues of fairness  accountability  ethics  and transparency in AI. There have been workshops at other conferences  and mostly there have been workshops at either natural-Â\\xadlanguage-processing-based conferences or machine-learning-based conferences. Itâ\\x80\\x99s really important to have the stand-alone conference because it needs to be worked on by people from many disciplines who talk to each other.\\n\\nMachine-learning people on their own cannot solve this problem. There are issues of transparency; there are issues of how the laws should be updated. If youâ\\x80\\x99re going to talk about bias in health care  you want to talk to [health-care professionals] about where the potential biases could be  and then you can think about how to have a machine-learning-based solution.\\n\\nWhat has been your experience working in AI?\\n\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s not easy. I love my job. I love the research that I work on. I love the field. I cannot imagine what else I would do in that respect. That being said  itâ\\x80\\x99s very difficult to be a black woman in this field. When I started Black in AI  I started it with a couple of my friends. I had a tiny mailing list before that where I literally would add any black person I saw in this field into the mailing list and be like  â\\x80\\x9cHi  Iâ\\x80\\x99m Timnit. Iâ\\x80\\x99m black person number two. Hi  black person number one. Letâ\\x80\\x99s be friends.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhat really just made it accelerate was [in 2016] when I went to NIPS and someone was saying there were an estimated 8 500 people. I counted six black people. I was literally panicking. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the only way I can describe how I felt. I saw that this field was growing exponentially  hitting the mainstream; itâ\\x80\\x99s affecting every part of society. At the same time  I also saw a lot of rhetoric about diversity and how a lot of companies think itâ\\x80\\x99s important.\\n\\nAnd I saw a mismatch between the rhetoric and action. Because six black people out of 8 500â\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s a ridiculous number  right? That is almost zero percent. I was like  â\\x80\\x9cWe have to do something now.â\\x80\\x9d I want to give a call to action to people who believe diversity is important. Because it is an emergency  and we have to do something about it now.  Future of Work Feb 1  2018 Half of Americans like universal basic income  and they want AI companies to pay for it A  recent Gallup poll  found that 48 percent of Americans see guaranteed income as a solution for helping workers displaced by automation. Partisan divide:  Support for the issue  varies greatly between political parties   while 65 percent of Democrats support it  only 28 percent of Republicans are on board (not exactly a shocker). Show me the money:  Still  of those in favor  only 45 percent were willing to pay higher taxes to fund such a program. Most people expected businesses that have adopted AI  and  presumably profited from that adoption  to provide the money. But:  Asking businesses to foot the bill for their own innovation is going to be a hard sell. As for whether universal basic income even works   a new 12-year study started  by MIT Sloan will give us a good clue. As we have said before  when you look closely  there are  some major flaws  in the idea. Want to stay up to date on the future of work? Sign up for our newest newsletter   Clocking In !

Emerging Technology from the arXiv Meet America  s newest military giant: Amazon Sharon Weinberger Machine vision has learned to use radio waves to see through walls and in darkness  Artificial Intelligence Algorithms are making American inequality worse In a new book  political scientist Virginia Eubanks says using computers to decide who gets social services hurts the poor. by     Jackie Snow Jan 26  2018 SADAF RASSOUL CAMERON\\n William Gibson wrote that the future is here  just not evenly distributed. The phrase is usually used to point out how the rich have more access to technology  but what happens when the poor are disproportionately subject to it? In  Automating Inequality   author Virginia Eubanks argues that the poor are the testing ground for new technology that increases inequality. The book  out this week  starts with a history of American poorhouses  which dotted the landscape starting in the 1660s and were around into the 20th century. From there  Eubanks catalogues how the poor have been treated over the last hundred years  before coming to today  s system of social services that increasingly relies on algorithms. Eubanks leaves no uncertainty as to her position on whether such automation is a good thing. Her thesis is that the punitive and moralistic view of poverty that built the poorhouses never left us  and has been wrapped into today  s automated and predictive decision-making tools. These algorithms can make it harder for people to get services while forcing them to deal with an invasive process of personal data collection. As examples  she profiles three different programs: a Medicaid application process in Indiana  homeless services in Los Angeles  and child protective services in Pittsburgh. Eubanks spoke to  MIT Technology Review  about when social services first became automated  her own experience with predictive algorithms  and how these flawed tools give her hope that inequality will be put into such stark relief that we will have to address how we treat our poor  once and for all. What are the parallels between the poorhouses of the past and what you call today  s digital poorhouses? These high-tech tools we\\'re seeing  I call it   the regime of data analytics  are actually more evolution than revolution. They fit pretty well within the history of poverty policy in the United States. When I originally started this work  I thought the moment that weâ\\x80\\x99d see these digital tools really arrive in public assistance and public services might be in the 1980s  when there was a widespread uptake of personal computers  or in the 1990s when welfare reform passed. But in fact  they arose in the late 1960s and early 1970s  just as a national welfare rights movement was opening up access to public assistance.\\n\\nAt the same time  there was a backlash against the civil rights movement going on  and a recession. So these elected officials  bureaucrats  and administrators were in this position where the middle-class public was pushing back against the expansion of public assistance. But they could no longer use their go-to strategy of excluding people from the rolls for largely discriminatory reasons. That\\'s the moment that we see these technologies arrive. What you see is an incredibly rapid decline in the welfare rolls right after theyâ\\x80\\x99re integrated into the systems. And that collapse has continued basically until today.\\n\\nSo for some of these algorithms that we have right now  machine-learning tools will replace them. In your research did you come across any issues that are going to arise once we have more AI within these systems?\\n\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t know that I have a direct response to it. But one thing I will say is that the Pittsburgh child services system often gets written about as if itâ\\x80\\x99s AI or machine learning. And in fact  itâ\\x80\\x99s actually just a simple statistical regression model.\\n\\nI do think itâ\\x80\\x99s really interesting  the way we tend to math-wash these systems  that we have a tendency to think they\\'re more complicated and harder to understand than they actually are. I suspect that there\\'s a little bit of technological hocus-pocus that happens when these systems come online and people often feel like they don\\'t understand them well enough to comment on them. But itâ\\x80\\x99s just not true. I think a lot more people that are currently talking about these issues are able to  confident to  and should be at the table when we talk about them.\\n\\nYou have a great quote from a woman on food stamps who tells you her caseworker looks at her purchase history. You appear surprised  so she says  \"You should pay attention to what happens to us. You\\'re next.\" Do you have examples of technologies that the general population deals with that are like this example?\\n\\nI start the book by talking about a case where my partner was attacked and very badly beaten. After he had gotten some major surgery  we were told at the pharmacy when I was trying to pick up his pain meds that we no longer had health insurance. In a panic  I called my insurance company and they told me basically that we were missing a start date for our coverage.\\n\\nI said  â\\x80\\x9cYou know  well  thatâ\\x80\\x99s odd  because you paid claims that we made a couple of weeks ago  so we must have had a start date at that point.â\\x80\\x9d And they said  â\\x80\\x9cOh  it must have just been a technical error. Somebody must have accidentally erased your start date or something.â\\x80\\x9d\\nI was really suspicious that what was actually going on was that they had suspended our coverage while they investigated us for fraud (I had been working on these kinds of fraud detection tools for a long time by then). And we had some of the most common indicators that insurance fraud was occurring: we had only had our insurance for a couple of days before the attack  we are not married  and he had received controlled substances to help him manage his pain.\\n\\nI will never know whether we were being investigated  but either way they were telling us that we owed upward of $60 000 in medical bills that had been denied because we werenâ\\x80\\x99t covered when the claims went through. It caused extraordinary stress.\\n\\nSo these systems are actually already at work  sort of invisibly  in many of the services that we interact with on a day-to-day basis  whether we are poor  working class or professional middle class  or economic elites. But they donâ\\x80\\x99t affect us all equally. My partner and I were able to endure that experience because we had resources to help us get through that experience  and also because it only happened to us once. It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t coming from every direction. It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t an overwhelming force where we\\'re hearing it from child protective services  and also Medicaid  and also food stamps  and also the police.\\n\\nI think it can be a lot harder for folks who are dealing with many of these systems at the same time.\\n\\nIs there anything good happening because of these tools?\\n\\nOne of the reasons Iâ\\x80\\x99m optimistic is that these systems are also really incredible diagnostics. They make inequities in our country really concrete  and really evident. Where one of the systems goes spiraling out of control is a place where we have a deep inequality that needs to be addressed. And so I believe that the combination of the movement work thatâ\\x80\\x99s already happening now and increased attention to systems like these can really create incredible pressure to create a more just social system overall.  Ethical Tech Jan 25  2018 The UK is doubling down on AI ethics and fake news At the World Economic Forum in Davos  British prime minister Theresa May says her country is taking aim at some of tech  s biggest issues. Fighting fake news:  A new UK national security unit  part of the nation  s defense program  will be   tasked with combating disinformation by state actors   notes the  Guardian . At Davos  May echoed  previous comments  by asking social-media firms to   step up to their responsibilities. Making AI moral:   The  Telegraph  ($) says  a UK Center for Data Ethics will try to make machine learning safe and ethical. It hopes to coordinate with other nations  and May says she hopes it will help Britain become a   world leader in innovation-friendly regulation. Warning to investors:   The BBC reports  that May has also urged investors to demand more from the firms they back  by   ensuring trust and safety issues are being properly considered. But:  It  s unclear if the UK government will be able to truly shape global action on these topics  especially in AI  where the country is a relatively minor player compared with the US and China.

Recent diversity reports show that women still make up only 20 percent of engineers at  Google  and  Facebook   and an even lower proportion at  Uber . But after the parade of awful news about the treatment of female engineers in 2017 sexual harassment in Silicon Valley  and a Google engineer  sending out a memo  to his coworkers arguing that women are biologically less adept at programming  just to name a couple  there is actually reason to believe that things are looking up for 2018  especially when it comes to AI. At first glance  AI would seem among least likely areas of programming to be friendly to women. Writing in  Fast Company  recently  Hanna Wallach  an AI researcher and cofounder of the Women in Machine Learning Conference  said that only 13.5 percent of those working in machine learning are female. In the midst of the #MeToo movement  researchers in artificial intelligence also dealt with  sexual harassment allegations   as well as complaints that inappropriate jokes were made at a parties around NIPS  a major industry conference. But three major new AI policy and advocacy groups have popped up lately  with big-time industry backing and lofty goals for changing the way AI is designed and implemented  and all are headed by women. Partnership for AI  a consortium made up of heavy hitters like Apple  Facebook  and Microsoft  just hired Terah Lyons as executive director. Lyons was formerly policy advisor to the U.S. chief technology officer at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)  where she was behind the Obama administration  s  deep dive into AI  s potential to change the world . The goal of Partnership for AI is to   advance public understanding of artificial intelligence technologies (AI) and formulate best practices on the challenges and opportunities within the field. With funding from some of the biggest tech firms in the world  it  s poised to help shape policy and thinking around AI at the federal level. Meanwhile  AI Now  a research institute at NYU  was officially launched this fall by Kate Crawford  a principal researcher at Microsoft Research  and Meredith Whittaker  a founder of Google Open Research. One of the groupâ\\x80\\x99s main focuses is to ensure that the engineers making AI algorithms are working closely with the people who will use them. In the case of a medical application  for example  they want to make sure that doctors are consulted as part of the research. This kind of work will help point AI toward tackling the kinds of problems that actually need solving  as opposed to only the problems that a computer programmer thinks to work on.\\n\\nAnd to help boost the ranks of women getting AI training  thereâ\\x80\\x99s AI4ALL  a nonprofit that puts on summer programs at Stanford and UC Berkeley to teach AI to diverse groups of high school students. Cofounded by computer vision expert Olga Russakovsky in 2016 (see â\\x80\\x9c35 Innovators under 35â\\x80\\x9d)  AI4ALL got funding from Melinda Gates this year and will be expanding to four more universities in 2018  focusing on teaching female  minority  and low-income students.\\n\\nSpeaking to MIT Technology Review  Russakovsky pointed out that AI4ALL isnâ\\x80\\x99t solely run by women: its board is 50 percent men.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYet we are now the outlier â\\x80\\x9d she said.\\n\\nFor her part  Russakovsky is a bit more bearish on whether 2018 will be much better for women in AI. After all  nonprofit groups are one thing  but a lot more power is still concentrated into the hands of a few white men living in the San Francisco area.\\n\\nBut what she sees in the summers with AI4ALL gives her hope. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know if it will change in 2018  but the shift has started â\\x80\\x9d Russakovsky said. â\\x80\\x9cThe change will happen with the next wave of students.â\\x80\\x9d  Siobhan Gallagher Artificial Intelligence New Research Aims to Solve the Problem of AI Bias in   Black Box Algorithms As we automate more and more decisions  being able to understand how an AI thinks is increasingly important. by     Jackie Snow Nov 7  2017 Siobhan Gallagher From picking stocks to examining x-rays  artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to make decisions that were formerly up to humans. But AI is only as good as the data it  s trained on  and in many cases we end up baking our all-too-human biases into algorithms that have the potential to make a huge impact on people  s lives. In a  new paper published on the arXiv   researchers say they may have figured out a way to mitigate the problem for algorithms that are difficult for outsiders to examine  so-called   black box systems. A particularly troubling area for bias to show up is in risk assessment modeling  which can decide  for example  a person  s chances of being granted bail or approved for a loan. It is typically illegal to consider factors like race in such cases  but algorithms can learn to recognize and exploit the fact that a person  s education level or home address may correlate with other demographic information  which can effectively imbue them with racial and other biases. What makes this problem even trickier is many of the AIs used to make those choices are black boxes  either they  re too complicated to easily understand  or they  re proprietary algorithms that companies refuse to explain. Researchers have been working on tools to get a look at what  s going on  under the hood   but the issue is widespread and growing (see    Biased Algorithms Are Everywhere  and No One Seems to Care   Ã¹). In the paper  Sarah Tan (who worked at Microsoft at the time) and colleagues tried their method on two black-box risk assessment models: one about loan risks and default rates from the peer-to-peer company LendingClub  and one from Northpointe  a company that provides algorithm-based services to courts around the country  predicting recidivism risk for defendants. The researchers used a two-pronged approach to shed light on how these potentially biased algorithms work. First  they created a model that mimics the black-box algorithm being examined and comes up with a risk score based on an initial set of data  just as LendingClub and Northpointe  s would. Then they built a second model that they trained on real-world outcomes  using it to determine which variables from the initial data set were important in final outcomes. In the case of LendingClub  the researchers analyzed data on a number of matured loans from 2007 to 2011. LendingClub  s database contained numerous different fields  but the researchers found that the company  s lending model probably ignored both the applicant  s annual income and the purpose of the loan. Income might make sense to ignore  since it  s self-reported and can be faked. But the purpose of the loan is highly correlated with risk  loans for small businesses are much riskier than those used to pay for weddings  for example. So LendingClub appeared to be ignoring an important variable. Northpointe  meanwhile  says its COMPAS algorithm does not include race as a variable when making recommendations on sentencing. However  in an investigation by  ProPublica   journalists collected racial information on defendants who were sentenced with help from COMPAS and found evidence of racial bias. In their mimic model  the researchers used the data gathered by ProPublica as well as information on the defendants   age  sex  charge degree  number of prior convictions  and length of any previous prison stay. The method agreed with ProPublica  s findings  suggesting that COMPAS was likely biased for some age and racial groups. Critics may point out that these aren  t exact replicas  out of necessity  the researchers were making a lot of educated guesses. But if the company behind an algorithm isn  t willing to release information on how its system works  approximation models like the ones from this research are a reasonable way to get insight  says Brendan O  Connor  an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts  Amherst  who has published a paper on bias in  natural-language processing .   We need to be aware this is happening  and not close our eyes to it and act like it  s not happening  O  Connor says. Share Link Tagged AI Ethics Author Jackie Snow Popular 0   1   .

Artificial Intelligence Oct 31  2017 Meet the Fake Celebrities Dreamed Up by AI We now have the perfect solution for celebrity obsession: an algorithm that conjures up new famous faces on demand. Researchers at Nvidia created the celeb-generating algorithm using a clever new machine-learning technique. The faces are dreamed up using a more efficient version of what  s known as a generative adversarial network (or GAN). A GAN consists of two neural networks  both trained using a particular data set. One network then tries to generate synthetic examples to fool the other network into thinking they came from the original data set. The process helps the first network improve its ability to produce realistic data. GANs were invented by Google researcher Ian Goodfellow (who is also one of our  35 Innovators Under 35 for 2017 )  and they have proved remarkably effective for synthesizing realistic-sounding speech and all sorts of dazzling imagery. They could prove very useful for generating animated graphics for video games  and for compressing video more efficiently. In  a paper  (PDF) submitted to an upcoming conference  the Nvidia researchers claim to have developed a better GAN by having it start off working with low-resolution images  and gradually increasing the image resolution as well as the size of the networks involved. They fed their GAN a data set of celebrity faces  and it produced some very realistic-looking faces (you can check out a video of the research  here ). One thing to note  however  is that a few of the images feature strange artifacts and features  like a missing eyebrow or teeth in the wrong place  not exactly things that would get you a gig on reality TV. This goes to show that even if machine learning can produce amazing visual trickery  it lacks the deeper intelligence required to make sense of the real world.

We  re talking about the risk that our unconscious sexism or unconscious racism seep into the machines that we  re building. How do we get anyone who  s building AI to think about these things?

Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics First Evidence That Online Dating Is Changing the Nature of Society Dating websites have changed the way couples meet. Now evidence is emerging that this change is influencing levels of interracial marriage and even the stability of marriage itself. by     Emerging Technology from the arXiv Oct 10  2017 Not so long ago  nobody met a partner online. Then  in the 1990s  came the first dating websites. Match.com went live in 1995. A new wave of dating websites  such as OKCupid  emerged in the early 2000s. And the 2012 arrival of Tinder changed dating even further. Today  more than one-third of marriages start online. Clearly  these sites have had a huge impact on dating behavior. But now the first evidence is emerging that their effect is much more profound.  The way people meet their partners has changed dramatically in recent years For more than 50 years  researchers have studied the nature of the networks that link people to each other. These social networks turn out to have a peculiar property. One obvious type of network links each node with its nearest neighbors  in a pattern like a chess board or chicken wire. Another obvious kind of network links nodes at random. But real social networks are not like either of these. Instead  people are strongly connected to a relatively small group of neighbors and loosely connected to much more distant people. These loose connections turn out to be extremely important.   Those weak ties serve as bridges between our group of close friends and other clustered groups  allowing us to connect to the global community  say Josue Ortega at the University of Essex in the U.K. and Philipp Hergovich at the University of Vienna in Austria. Loose ties have traditionally played a key role in meeting partners. While most people were unlikely to date one of their best friends  they were highly likely to date people who were linked with their group of friends; a friend of a friend  for example. In the language of network theory  dating partners were embedded in each other  s networks. Indeed  this has long been reflected in surveys of the way people meet their partners: through mutual friends  in bars  at work  in educational institutions  at church  through their families  and so on. Online dating has changed that. Today  online dating is the second most common way for heterosexual couples to meet. For homosexual couples  it is far and away the most popular. That has significant implications.   People who meet online tend to be complete strangers  say Ortega and Hergovich. And when people meet in this way  it sets up social links that were previously nonexistent. The question that Ortega and Hergovich investigate is how this changes the racial diversity of society.   Understanding the evolution of interracial marriage is an important problem  for intermarriage is widely considered a measure of social distance in our societies  they say. The researchers start by simulating what happens when extra links are introduced into a social network. Their network consists of men and women from different races who are randomly distributed. In this model  everyone wants to marry a person of the opposite sex but can only marry someone with whom a connection exists. This leads to a society with a relatively low level of interracial marriage. But if the researchers add random links between people from different ethnic groups  the level of interracial marriage changes dramatically.   Our model predicts nearly complete racial integration upon the emergence of online dating  even if the number of partners that individuals meet from newly formed ties is small  say Ortega and Hergovich. And there is another surprising effect. The team measure the strength of marriages by measuring the average distance between partners before and after the introduction of online dating.   Our model also predicts that marriages created in a society with online dating tend to be stronger  they say. Next  the researchers compare the results of their models to the observed rates of interracial marriage in the U.S. This has been on the increase for some time  but the rates are still low  not least because interracial marriage was banned in some parts of the country until 1967. But the rate of increase changed at about the time that online dating become popular.   It is intriguing that shortly after the introduction of the first dating websites in 1995  like Match.com  the percentage of new marriages created by interracial couples increased rapidly  say the researchers. The increase became steeper in the 2000s  when online dating became even more popular.  Then  in 2014  the proportion of interracial marriages jumped again.   It is interesting that this increase occurs shortly after the creation of Tinder  considered the most popular online dating app  they say. Tinder has some 50 million users and produces more than 12 million matches a day. Of course  this data doesn  t prove that online dating caused the rise in interracial marriages. But it is consistent with the hypothesis that it does. Meanwhile  research into the strength of marriage has found some evidence that married couples who meet online have lower rates of marital breakup than those who meet traditionally. That has the potential to significantly benefit society. And it  s exactly what Ortega and Hergovich  s model predicts. Of course  there are other factors that could contribute to the increase in interracial marriage. One is that the trend is the result of a reduction in the percentage of Americans who are white. If marriages were random  this should increase the number of interracial marriages  but not by the observed amount.   The change in the population composition in the U.S. cannot explain the huge increase in intermarriage that we observe  say Ortega and Hergovich. That leaves online dating as the main driver of this change. And if that  s the case  the model implies that this change is ongoing. That  s a profound revelation. These changes are set to continue  and to benefit society as result.

But it  s a revolution that needs to include more people. She spoke with  MIT Technology Review  senior editor Will Knight about why everyone benefits if we emphasize the human side of the technology. This story is part of our     November/December 2017     issue See the rest of the issue Subscribe Why did you join Google? Researching cutting-edge AI is very satisfying and rewarding  but we  re seeing this great awakening  a great moment in history. For me it  s very important to think about AI  s impact in the world  and one of the most important missions is to democratize this technology. The cloud is this gigantic computing vehicle that delivers computing services to every single industry. What have you learned so far? We need to be much more human-centered. If you look at where we are in AI  I would say it  s the great triumph of pattern recognition. It is very task-focused  it lacks contextual awareness  and it lacks the kind of flexible learning that humans have. We also want to make technology that makes humans   lives better  our world safer  our lives more productive and better. All this requires a layer of human-level communication and collaboration. How can we make AI more human-centered? There  s a great phrase  written in the   70s:   the definition of today  s AI is a machine that can make a perfect chess move while the room is on fire. It really speaks to the limitations of AI. In the next wave of AI research  if we want to make more helpful and useful machines  we  ve got to bring back the contextual understanding. We  ve got to bring knowledge abstraction and reasoning. These are all the most important steps. At Stanford you created  Visual Genome   a database of images that are extensively labeled so they can be used for AI systems. Is this interplay of vision and language necessary for the next leap forward? Absolutely. Vision is a cornerstone of intelligence  and language understanding is a cornerstone of intelligence. What makes humans unique is that evolution gave us the most incredible and sophisticated vision system  motor system  and language system  and they all work together. Visual Genome is exactly the kind of project that  s pushing the boundaries of language understanding and visual understanding. And eventually we  re going to connect with the world of robotics as well.\\n\\nYouâ\\x80\\x99ve talked about the need to have more women involved in AI. Why?\\n\\nMore jobs will be related to artificial intelligence  so we need a huge workforce  and we need a more inclusive base. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s an economic argument. There are also tons of studies that have shown that when a diverse group of workers come together  the solutions they find in their work are more innovative and more creative. That drives innovation. But itâ\\x80\\x99s also moral and ethical.\\n\\nWhen you are making a technology this pervasive and this important for humanity  you want it to carry the values of the entire humanity  and serve the needs of the entire humanity. If the developers of this technology do not represent all walks of life  it is very likely that this will be a biased technology. I say this as a technologist  a researcher  and a mother. And we need to be speaking about this clearly and loudly.  John Giannandrea. Getty Artificial Intelligence  /  Robots Forget Killer Robots  Bias Is the Real AI Danger John Giannandrea  who leads AI at Google  is worried about intelligent systems learning human prejudices. by     Will Knight Oct 3  2017 John Giannandrea. Getty Google  s AI chief isn  t fretting about super-intelligent killer robots. Instead  John Giannandrea is concerned about the danger that may be lurking inside the machine-learning algorithms used to make millions of decisions every minute.   The real safety question  if you want to call it that  is that if we give these systems biased data  they will be biased  Giannandrea said before a recent Google conference on the relationship between humans and AI systems. The problem of bias in machine learning is likely to become more significant as the technology spreads to critical areas like medicine and law  and as more people without a deep technical understanding are tasked with deploying it. Some experts warn that algorithmic bias is already pervasive in many industries  and that almost no one is making an effort to identify or correct it (see    Biased Algorithms Are Everywhere  and No One Seems to Care   Ã¹).   It  s important that we be transparent about the training data that we are using  and are looking for hidden biases in it  otherwise we are building biased systems  Giannandrea added.

Sign up for     The Download      your daily dose of what\\'s up in emerging technology Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No Black box machine-learning models are already having a major impact on some people  s lives. A system called COMPAS  made by a company called Northpointe  offers to predict defendants   likelihood of reoffending  and is used by some judges to determine whether an inmate is granted parole. The workings of COMPAS are kept secret  but an  investigation  by  ProPublica found evidence that the model may be biased against minorities.\\n\\nIt may not always be as simple as publishing details of the data or the algorithm employed  however. Many of the most powerful emerging machine-learning techniques are so complex and opaque in their workings that they defy careful examination (see â\\x80\\x9cThe Dark Secret at the Heart of AIâ\\x80\\x9d). To address this issue  researchers are exploring ways to make these systems give some approximation of their workings to engineers and end users.\\n\\nGiannandrea has good reason to highlight the potential for bias to creep into AI. Google is among several big companies touting the AI capabilities of its cloud computing platforms to all sorts of businesses. These cloud-based machine-learning systems are designed to be a lot easier to use than the underlying algorithms. This will help make the technology more accessible  but it could also make it easier for bias to creep in. It will be important to also offer tutorials and tools to help less experienced data scientists and engineers identify and remove bias from their training data.\\n\\nSeveral of the speakers invited to the conference organized by Google also highlighted the issue of bias. Google researcher Maya Gupta described her efforts to build less opaque algorithms as part of a team known internally as â\\x80\\x9cGlassBox.â\\x80\\x9d And Karrie Karahalios  a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois  presented research highlighting how tricky it can be to spot bias in even the most commonplace algorithms. Karahalios showed that users donâ\\x80\\x99t generally understand how Facebook filters the posts shown in their news feed. While this might seem innocuous  it is a neat illustration of how difficult it is to interrogate an algorithm.\\n\\nFacebookâ\\x80\\x99s news feed algorithm can certainly shape the public perception of social interactions and even major news events. Other algorithms may already be subtly distorting the kinds of medical care a person receives  or how they get treated in the criminal justice system. This is surely a lot more important than killer robots  at least for now.\\n\\nGiannandrea has certainly been a voice of reason in recent years among some more fanciful warnings about the risks posed by AI. Elon Musk  in particular  has generated countless headlines by warning recently that AI is a bigger threat than North Korea  and could result in World War III.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat I object to is this assumption that we will leap to some kind of super-intelligent system that will then make humans obsolete â\\x80\\x9d Giannandrea said. â\\x80\\x9cI understand why people are concerned about it but I think itâ\\x80\\x99s gotten way too much airtime. I just see no technological basis as to why this is imminent at all.â\\x80\\x9d  Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning Biased Algorithms Are Everywhere  and No One Seems to Care The big companies developing them show no interest in fixing the problem. by     Will Knight Jul 12  2017 Kate Crawford  speaking at the AI Now conference at MIT this week. John Maeda (@johnmaeda) Opaque and potentially biased mathematical models are remaking our lives  and neither the companies responsible for developing them nor the government is interested in addressing the problem. This week a group of researchers  together with the American Civil Liberties Union  launched an effort to identify and highlight algorithmic bias. The  AI Now initiative  was announced at an event held at MIT to discuss what many experts see as a growing challenge. Algorithmic bias is shaping up to be a major societal issue at a critical moment in the evolution of machine learning and AI. If the bias lurking inside the algorithms that make ever-more-important decisions goes unrecognized and unchecked  it could have serious negative consequences  especially for poorer communities and minorities. The eventual outcry might also stymie the progress of an incredibly useful technology (see    Inspecting Algorithms for Bias   Ã¹). Algorithms that may conceal hidden biases are already routinely used to make vital financial and legal decisions. Proprietary algorithms are used to decide  for instance  who gets a job interview  who  gets granted parole   and who  gets a loan . The founders of the new AI Now Initiative   Kate Crawford   a researcher at Microsoft  and Meredith Whittaker  a researcher at Google  say bias may exist in all sorts of services and products.   It  s still early days for understanding algorithmic bias  Crawford and Whittaker said in an e-mail.   Just this year we  ve seen more systems that have issues  and these are just the ones that have been investigated. Examples of algorithmic bias that have come to light lately  they say  include flawed and misrepresentative  systems used to rank teachers   and  gender-biased models for natural language processing . Cathy O  Neil  a mathematician and the author of  Weapons of Math Destruction   a book that highlights the risk of algorithmic bias in many contexts  says people are often too willing to trust in mathematical models because they believe it will remove human bias.   [Algorithms] replace human processes  but they  re not held to the same standards  she says.   People trust them too much. A key challenge  these and other researchers say  is that crucial stakeholders  including the companies that develop and apply machine learning systems and government regulators  show little interest in monitoring and limiting algorithmic bias. Financial and technology companies use all sorts of mathematical models and aren  t transparent about how they operate. O  Neil says  for example  she is concerned about how the algorithms behind Google  s new job search service work.

Tech Policy Secret Algorithms Threaten the Rule of Law Sending people to jail because of the inexplicable  unchallengeable judgments of a secret computer program undermines our legal system. by     Frank Pasquale Jun 1  2017 Predicting and shaping what you will do next  whether as a shopper  worker  or voter  is big business for data-driven firms. But should their methods also inform judges and prosecutors? An ambitious program of predicting recidivism among convicts is bringing algorithmic risk assessments to American courthouses.  These assessments are an extension of a trend toward  actuarial prediction instruments  for recidivism risk. They may seem scientific  an injection of computational rationality into a criminal justice system riddled with discrimination and inefficiency. However  they are troubling for several reasons: many are secretly computed; they deny due process and intelligible explanations to defendants; and they promote a crabbed and inhumane vision of the role of punishment in society. Let  s start with secrecy  a factor that has apparently alarmed even the Supreme Court in the case of the firm Northpointe  s COMPAS risk score. In  Loomis v. Wisconsin   a judge rejected a plea deal and sentenced a defendant (Loomis) to a harsher punishment in part because a COMPAS risk score deemed him of higher than average risk of recidivating. Loomis appealed the sentence  arguing that neither he nor the judge could examine the formula for the risk assessment  it was a trade secret.  Frank Pasquale The state of Wisconsin countered that Northpointe required it to keep the algorithms confidential  to protect the firm  s intellectual property. And the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld Loomis  s sentence  reasoning that the risk assessment was only one part of the rationale for the sentence. It wanted to continue to give judges the opportunity to take into account the COMPAS score as one part of their sentencing rationale  even if they had no idea how it was calculated. Lawyers   academics  and  activists  are now questioning that reasoning. Judicial processes are  by and large  open to the public. Judges must give reasons for their most important actions  such as sentencing. When an algorithmic scoring process is kept secret  it is  impossible to challenge  key aspects of it. How is the algorithm weighting different data points  and why? Each of these inquiries is crucial to two core legal principles: due process  and the ability to meaningfully appeal an adverse decision. Due process is an open-ended concept  but critical to legitimate legal systems. This basic constitutional principle gives defendants a right to understand what they are charged with  and what the evidence against them is. A secret risk assessment algorithm that offers a damning score is analogous to evidence offered by an  anonymous expert   whom one cannot cross-examine. Any court aware of foundational rule of law principles  as well as Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment principles of notice and explanation for decisions  would be very wary of permitting a state to base sentences (even if only in part) on a secret algorithm. Two forms of automation bias also menace the right to a meaningful appeal. Judges are all too likely to assume that quantitative methods are superior to ordinary verbal reasoning  and to reduce the task at hand (sentencing) to an application of the quantitative data available about recidivism risk. Both responses undermine the complexity and humane judgment necessary to sentencing. Even worse  when companies offer commercial rationales for keeping their   secret sauce out of the public eye  courts have been eager to protect the trade secrets of scoring firms. That tendency is troubling  in private-sector contexts   since commercial torts may be committed with impunity thanks to the opacity of ranking and rating systems. Even in the context of  voting   authorities have been sluggish about demanding software that is auditable and understandable  by outsiders . Nevertheless  the case of criminal sentencing should be a bridge too far for conscientious judges  and that probably explains the U.S. Supreme Court  s  interest  in  Loomis.   Sending someone to jail thanks to the inexplicable  unchallengeable judgments of a secret computer program is too  Black Mirror  for even hardened defenders of corporate privileges.  Moreover  there are options between   complete algorithmic secrecy and   complete public disclosure. As I  explained  in 2010    qualified transparency is a well-established method of enabling certain experts to assess protected trade secrets (including firms   code and data) in order to test a system  s quality  validity  and reliability. Think of a special master in a court case  or Secure Compartmented Information Facilities for intelligence agencies. At a bare minimum  governments should not use algorithms like the COMPAS score without some kind of external quality assurance enabled by qualified transparency. But secrecy is not the only problem here. Assume that algorithmic risk assessment eventually becomes more public  with fully transparent formulae and data. There are still serious concerns about the use of   evidence-based sentencing  as quantitative predictive analytics is often marketed in criminal justice contexts.  For example  legal scholar Sonja Starr has  argued  that what is really critical in the sentencing context is not just recidivism in itself  but the difference a longer prison term will make to the likelihood a convict will reoffend. Algorithmic risk assessment may eventually become very good at predicting reoffense  but what about a risk assessment of risk assessment itself  that is  the danger that a longer sentence for a   high risk offender may become a self-fulfilling prophecy  given the criminogenic environment of many prisons? There is also value in narrative intelligibility in the ranking and rating of human beings. Companies are marketing analytics to predict not only the likelihood of criminal recidivism  but also the chances that any given person will be  mentally ill   a bad  employee   a  failing student   a  criminal   or a  terrorist . Even if we can set aside the self-fulfilling prophecy concerns raised above  these assessments should be deployed only with utmost caution. Once used to advise police  DHS  teachers  or bosses  they are not mere opinions circulating in a free flow of ideas. Rather  they can have direct impact on persons   livelihoods  liberty  and education. If they cannot be explained in a narratively intelligible way  perhaps they should not be used at all without the direct consent of the person they are evaluating. This opinion may not sit well with those who see artificial intelligence as the next step in human evolution. Roboticist Hod Lipson memorably  compared  efforts to make advanced algorithmic information-processing understandable to humans to   explaining Shakespeare to a dog. But this loaded metaphor conceals more than it reveals. At least for now  humans are in charge of governments  and can demand explanations for decisions in natural language  not computer code. Failing to do so in the criminal context risks ceding inherently governmental and legal functions to an unaccountable computational elite.  Frank Pasquale  is a professor of law at the University of Maryland  and author of  The Black Box Society .  Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning Real or Fake? AI Is Making It Very Hard to Know Thanks to machine learning  it  s becoming easy to generate realistic video  and to impersonate someone. by     Will Knight May 1  2017 News headlines might not be the only things that are fake in the future. Powerful machine-learning techniques (see    The Dark Secret at the Heart of AI   Ã¹) are making it increasingly easy to manipulate or generate realistic video and audio  and to impersonate anyone you want with amazing accuracy. A smartphone app called  FaceApp   released recently by a company based in Russia  can automatically modify someone  s face to add a smile  add or subtract years  or swap genders. The app can also apply   beautifying effects that include smoothing out wrinkles and  more controversially  lightening the skin. And last week a company called  Lyrebird   which was spun out of the University of Montreal  demonstrated technology that it says can be used to impersonate another person  s voice. The company posted demonstration clips of Barack Obama  Donald Trump  and Hillary Clinton all endorsing the technology. These are just two examples of how the most powerful AI algorithms can be used for generating content rather than simply analyzing data. Powerful graphics hardware and software  as well as new video-capture technologies  are also driving this trend. Last year researchers at Stanford University demonstrated a face-swapping program called  Face2Face . This system can manipulate video footage so that a person  s facial expressions match those of someone being tracked using a depth-sensing camera. The result is often eerily realistic. The ability to manipulate voices and faces so realistically could raise a number of issues  as the creators of Lyrebird acknowledge.   Voice recordings are currently considered as strong pieces of evidence in our societies and in particular in jurisdictions of many countries  reads an ethics statement posted to the company  s website.   Our technology questions the validity of such evidence as it allows to easily manipulate audio recordings. This could potentially have dangerous consequences. Both FaceApp and Lyrebird use deep generative convolutional networks to enable these tricks. This means the company is applying a technique that has emerged in recent years as a way of getting algorithms to go beyond just learning to classify things and generate plausible data of their own. Like many tasks in artificial intelligence today  this involves using very large  or deep  neural networks. Such networks are normally fed training data and tweaked so that they respond in the desired way to new input. For example  they can be trained to recognize faces or objects in images with amazing accuracy. Sign up for     The Download      your daily dose of what\\'s up in emerging technology Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No But the same networks can then be made to generate their own data based on what were able to internalize about the data set they were trained on. It is possible to train such a network to  generate images  from scratch that look almost like the real thing. In the future  using the same techniques  it may become a lot easier to manipulate video  too.   At some point it  s likely that generating whole videos with neural nets will become possible  says  Alexandre de Brâ\\x88\\x9aÂ©bisson   a cofounder of Lyrebird.   It  s more challenging because there is a lot of variability in the high dimensional space representing videos  and current models for it are still not perfect. Given the technologies that are now emerging  it may become increasingly important to be able to detect fake video and audio. Justus Thies   a doctoral student at Friedrich Alexander University in Germany and one of the researchers behind Face2Face  the real-time face-swapping app  says he has started a project aimed at detecting manipulation of video.   Intermediate results look promising  he says.  Intelligent Machines Tech Giants Grapple with the Ethical Concerns Raised by the AI Boom As machines take over more decisions from humans  new questions about fairness  ethics  and morality arise. by     Tom Simonite Mar 30  2017 With great power comes great responsibility  and artificial-intelligence technology is getting much more powerful. Companies in the vanguard of developing and deploying machine learning and AI are now starting to talk openly about ethical challenges raised by their increasingly smart creations.   We  re here at an inflection point for AI  said Eric Horvitz  managing director of Microsoft Research  at  MIT Technology Review   s EmTech conference  this week.   We have an ethical imperative to harness AI to protect and preserve over time. Horvitz spoke alongside researchers from IBM and Google pondering similar issues. One shared concern was that recent advances are leading companies to put software in positions with very direct control over humans  for example in health care. Francesca Rossi   a researcher at IBM  gave the example of a machine providing assistance or companionship to elderly people.   This robot will have to follow cultural norms that are culture-specific and task-specific  she said.   [And] if you were to deploy in the U.S. or Japan  that behavior would have to be very different. Such robots may still be a ways off  but ethical challenges raised by AI are already here. As businesses and governments rely more on machine-learning systems to make decisions  blind spots or biases in the technology can effectively lead to discrimination against certain types of people. A ProPublica investigation last year  for example  found that a risk-scoring system used in some states to inform criminal sentencing was  biased against blacks . Similarly  Horvitz described how an emotion-recognition service developed at Microsoft for use by businesses was initially inaccurate for small children because it was trained using a grab bag of photos that wasn  t properly curated. Maya Gupta  a researcher at Google  called for the industry to work harder on developing processes to ensure data used to train algorithms isn  t skewed.   A lot of times these data sets are being created in a somewhat automated way  said Gupta.   We have to think more about  are we sampling enough from minority groups to be sure we did a good enough job? In the past year  many efforts to research the ethical challenges of machine learning and AI have sprung up in academia and industry. The University of California  Berkeley; Harvard; and the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge have all started programs or institutes to work on ethics and safety in AI. In 2016  Amazon  Microsoft  Google  IBM  and Facebook jointly founded a nonprofit called  Partnership on AI  to work on the problem (Apple joined in January). Companies are also taking individual action to build safeguards around their technology. Gupta highlighted research at Google that is testing ways to correct biased machine-learning models  or prevent them from becoming skewed in the first place. Horvitz described Microsoft  s internal ethics board for AI  dubbed AETHER  which considers things like new decision algorithms developed for the company  s in-cloud services. Although currently populated with Microsoft employees  in future the company hopes to add outside voices as well. Google has started its own AI ethics board. Perhaps unsurprisingly  the companies creating such programs generally argue they obviate the need for new forms of government regulation of artificial intelligence. But at EmTech  Horvitz also encouraged discussion of extreme outcomes that might lead some people to conclude the opposite. In February he convened a workshop where experts laid out in detail how AI might harm society by doing things like messing with the stock market or election results.   If you  re proactive  you can come up with outcomes that are feasible and put mechanisms in place to disrupt them now  said Horvitz. That kind of talk seemed to unnerve some of those he shared the stage with in San Francisco. Gupta of Google encouraged people to also consider how taking some decisions out of the hands of humans could make the world more moral than it is now.   Machine learning is controllable and precise and measurable with statistics  she said.   There are so many possibilities for more fairness  and more ethical results.  Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning How to Fix Silicon Valley  s Sexist Algorithms Computers are inheriting gender bias implanted in language data sets  and not everyone thinks we should correct it. by     Will Knight Nov 23  2016 The presidential campaign made clear that chauvinist attitudes toward women remain stubbornly fixed in some parts of society. It turns out we  re inadvertently teaching artificial-intelligence systems to be sexist  too. New research shows that subtle gender bias is entrenched in the data sets used to teach language skills to AI programs. As these systems become more capable and widespread  their sexist point of view could have negative consequences  in job searches  for instance. The problem results from the way machines are being taught to read and talk. Computer scientists are feeding them huge quantities of written or spoken language  and letting them draw connections between words and phrases. The resulting data sets  known as word embeddings  are widely used to train AI systems that handle language  including chatbots  translation systems  image-captioning programs  and recommendation algorithms. Word embeddings represent the relationships between words as  mathematical values . This makes it possible for a machine to perceive  semantic connections  between  say    king and   queen and understand that the relationship between the two words is similar to that between   man and   woman. But researchers from Boston University and Microsoft Research New England also found that the data sets considered the word   programmer closer to the word   man than   woman  and that the most similar word for   woman is   homemaker. James Zou   an assistant professor at Stanford University who conducted the research while at Microsoft  says this could have a range of unintended consequences.   We are still trying to understand the full impact that comes from the many AI systems using these biased embeddings  Zou says. Zou and colleagues have conducted some simple experiments that show how this gender bias might manifest itself. When they wrote a program designed to read Web pages and rank their relevance  they found the system would rank information about female programmers as less relevant than that about their male counterparts. The researchers also developed a way to remove gender bias from embeddings by adjusting the mathematical relationship between gender-neutral words like   programmer and gendered words such as   man and   woman. But not everyone believes gender bias should be eliminated from the data sets.  Arvind Narayanan   an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton  has also analyzed word embedding and found gender  racial  and other prejudices. But Narayanan cautions against removing bias automatically  arguing that it could skew a computer  s representation of the real world and make it less adept at making predictions or analyzing data.   We should think of these not as a bug but a feature  Narayanan says.   It really depends on the application. What constitutes a terrible bias or prejudice in one application might actually end up being exactly the meaning you want to get out of the data in another application. Several word embedding data sets exist  including Word2Vec  created by researchers at Google  and GloVe  developed at Stanford University. Google declined to comment on research showing gender bias in Word2Vec  but the company is clearly conscious of the challenge. A recent  blog post  describes a technical approach to removing bias from decision-making AI systems without affecting their usefulness. Biased AI systems could exacerbate the unfairness that already exists  says  Barbara Grosz   a professor at Harvard University.   When you are in a society that is evolving in certain ways  then you are actually trying to change the future to be not like the past  says Grosz  who cowrote a report called AI 100  a project from Stanford University aimed at understanding the potential dangers of AI (see    AI Wants to Be Your Bro  Not Your Foe   Ã¹).   And to the extent that we rely on algorithms that do that kind of predicting  Grosz says    there  s an ethical question about whether we  re inhibiting the very evolution that we want.  Grosz concedes that there may be situations when it doesn  t make sense to remove bias from a data set.   It  s not that you can avoid all these kinds of bias  but we need to be mindful in our design  and we need to be mindful about what we claim about our programs and their results  Grosz adds.   For many of these ethical questions  there isn  t a single right answer.  Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics Yes  We Are Worried About the Existential Risk of Artificial Intelligence A defense of the warnings about AI in philosopher Nick Bostrom  s book  Superintelligence . by     Allan Dafoe and Stuart Russell Nov 2  2016 Oren Etzioni  a well-known AI researcher  complains about news coverage of potential long-term risks arising from future success in AI research (see    No  Experts Don\\'t Think Superintelligent AI is a Threat to Humanity   Ã¹). After pointing the finger squarely at Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom and his recent book   Superintelligence   Etzioni complains that Bostrom  s   main source of data on the advent of human-level intelligence consists of surveys on the opinions of AI researchers. He then surveys the opinions of AI researchers  arguing that his results refute Bostrom  s. It  s important to understand that Etzioni is not even addressing the reason  Superintelligence  has had the impact he decries: its clear explanation of why superintelligent AI may have arbitrarily negative consequences and why it  s important to begin addressing the issue well in advance. Bostrom  does not  base his case on predictions that superhuman AI systems are imminent. He writes    It is no part of the argument in this book that we are on the threshold of a big breakthrough in artificial intelligence  or that we can predict with any precision when such a development might occur. Thus  in our view  Etzioni  s article distracts the reader from the core argument of the book and directs an ad hominem attack against Bostrom under the pretext of disputing his survey results. We feel it is necessary to correct the record. One of us (Russell) even contributed to Etzioni  s survey  only to see his response being completely misconstrued. In fact  as our  detailed analysis  shows  Etzioni  s survey results are entirely consistent with the ones Bostrom cites. How  then  does Etzioni reach his novel conclusion? By designing a survey instrument that is  inferior  to Bostrom  s and then  misinterpreting  the results. The subtitle of the article reads    If you ask the people who should really know  you  ll find that few believe AI is a threat to humanity. So the reader is led to believe that Etzioni asked this question of the people who should really know  while Bostrom did not. In fact  the opposite is true: Bostrom  did  ask people who should really know  but Etzioni did not ask anyone at all. Bostrom surveyed the top 100 most cited AI researchers. More than half of the respondents said they believe there is a substantial (at least 15 percent) chance that the effect of human-level machine intelligence on humanity will be   on balance bad or   extremely bad (existential catastrophe). Etzioni  s survey  unlike Bostrom  s   did not ask any questions  about a threat to humanity. Instead  he simply asks one question about  when  we will achieve superintelligence. As Bostrom  s data would have already predicted  somewhat more than half (67.5 percent) of Etzioni  s respondents plumped for   more than 25 years to achieve superintelligence  after all  more than half of Bostrom  s respondents gave dates beyond 25 years for a mere 50 percent probability of achieving mere human-level intelligence. One of us (Russell) responded to Etzioni  s survey with   more than 25 years  and Bostrom himself writes  of his own surveys    My own view is that the median numbers reported in the expert survey do not have enough probability mass on later arrival dates. Now  having designed a survey where respondents could be expected to choose   more than 25 years  Etzioni springs his trap: he asserts that 25 years is   beyond the foreseeable horizon and thereby deduces that neither Russell nor indeed Bostrom himself believes that superintelligent AI is a threat to humanity. This will come as a surprise to Russell and Bostrom  and presumably to many other respondents in the survey. (Indeed  Etzioni  s headline could just as easily have been   75 percent of experts think superintelligent AI is inevitable.  Ã¹) Should we ignore catastrophic risks simply because most experts think they are more than 25 years away? By Etzioni  s logic  we should also ignore the catastrophic risks of climate change and castigate those who bring them up. Contrary to the views of Etzioni and some others in the  AI community   pointing to long-term risks from AI is  not  equivalent to claiming that superintelligent AI and its accompanying risks are   imminent. The list of those who have pointed to the risks includes such luminaries as Alan Turing  Norbert Wiener  I.J. Good  and Marvin Minsky. Even Oren Etzioni has  acknowledged these challenges . To our knowledge  none of these ever asserted that superintelligent AI was imminent. Nor  as noted above  did Bostrom in  Superintelligence . Etzioni then repeats the dubious argument that   doom-and-gloom predictions often fail to consider the potential benefits of AI in preventing medical errors  reducing car accidents  and more. The argument does not even apply to Bostrom  who predicts that success in controlling AI will result in   a compassionate and jubilant use of humanity  s cosmic endowment. The argument is also nonsense. It  s like arguing that nuclear engineers who analyze the possibility of meltdowns in nuclear power stations are   failing to consider the potential benefits of cheap electricity  and that because nuclear power stations might one day generate really cheap electricity  we should neither mention  nor work on preventing  the possibility of a meltdown. Our experience with Chernobyl suggests it may be unwise to claim that a powerful technology entails no risks. It may also be unwise to claim that a powerful technology will never come to fruition. On September 11  1933  Lord Rutherford  perhaps the world  s most eminent nuclear physicist  described the prospect of extracting energy from atoms as nothing but   moonshine. Less than 24 hours later  Leo Szilard invented the neutron-induced nuclear chain reaction; detailed designs for nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons followed a few years later. Surely it is better to anticipate human ingenuity than to underestimate it  better to acknowledge the risks than to deny them. Many prominent AI experts have recognized the possibility that AI presents an existential risk. Contrary to misrepresentations in the media  this risk need not arise from spontaneous malevolent consciousness. Rather  the risk arises from the unpredictability and potential irreversibility of deploying an optimization process more intelligent than the humans who specified its objectives. This problem was stated clearly by Norbert Wiener in 1960  and we still have not solved it. We invite the reader to support the ongoing efforts to do so. Allan Dafoe is an assistant professor of political science at Yale University.  Stuart Russell is a professor of computer science at the University of California  Berkeley.   Response from Oren Etzioni  November 2  2016: I  m delighted that Professors Dafoe & Russell   and I seem to be in agreement on three critical matters. One  we should refrain from ad hominem attacks. Here  I have to offer an apology: I should not have quoted the anonymous AAAI Fellow who likened Dr. Bostrom to Donald Trump. I didn  t mean to lend my voice to that comparison; I sincerely apologized to Bostrom for this misstep via e-mail  an apology that he graciously accepted. Two  as scientists  we need to assess statements about the risk of AI  based on data.  That was the key point of my  brief article   and the article offered unique data on this topic. Three  we also concur that the media has misrepresented the implications of Bostrom  s work  a topic of major concern that was allayed to some extent by the  White House report on AI . Of course  we do differ on many of the details and the intricacies of the arguments  but time will tell.  Intelligent Machines Tech Titans Join Forces to Stop AI from Behaving Badly The new partnership is also designed to head off unwanted regulation. by     Will Knight Sep 28  2016 When it comes to policing artificial intelligence  technology leaders think there is safety in numbers. A new organization called the  Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society  will seek to foster public dialogue and create guidelines for developing AI so that systems do not misbehave. The companies involved include Google and its subsidiary DeepMind  Facebook  Amazon  Microsoft  and IBM. The partnership is founded on eight tenets or principles  including the idea that AI should benefit as many people as possible; that the public should be involved in its development; that research should be conducted in an open way; and that AI systems should be able to explain their reasoning. That such fierce rivals would come together in this way shows how important the companies feel it is to head off public concern and speculation over the potential impacts of AI. These businesses are all reaping huge rewards from advances in AI  and they do not wish to see their industry subject to strict government regulation  which could slow or alter the technology  s progress at a critical moment in its evolution. But at the same time  rapid recent advances have raised concerns about the potential for AI systems to discriminate  disadvantage  and displace people.   We all share a duty to take the field forward in a thoughtful and positive and  importantly  ethical way  says Mustafa Suleyman  cofounder of Google DeepMind and interim co-chair of the organization.   The positive impacts of AI will depend not only on the quality of our algorithms  but on the level of public engagement  of transparency  and ethical discussion that takes place around it. AI is advancing at such a breakneck speed that there are legitimate concerns about it being deployed in ways that have unintended or unwanted effects. For instance  a machine-learning system designed to identify disease that is fed biased data might discriminate against certain people. The companies involved in the partnership recognize that a backlash could emerge in response to such effects.   AI is an incredibly important technology for Amazon  says Rolf Herbrich  director of machine learning for the e-commerce giant.   [And] the biggest asset in the customer experience is customer trust. It  s unclear precisely how the organization will engage with the public or those developing AI. It will not seek to enforce its guidelines so much as to lead an open discussion  according to Suleyman. There are also legitimate concerns over the potential for AI and related technologies such as robotics to displace people and increase inequality (see    How Technology Is Destroying Jobs   Ã¹). But recent progress has led to some more outlandish and futuristic warnings about the potential for AI to pose an existential threat to humanity (see    Our Fear of Artificial Intelligence   Ã¹). One concern among technologists is that these warnings could stoke unwarranted public outcry and inspire unnecessary government regulations.   With all the hyperbole about AI over the last two to four years  there  s been concern that in that echo chamber of anxiety the government itself will be misinformed  says Eric Horvitz  managing director of Microsoft Research and the organization  s other co-chair. The government has signaled an interest in ensuring that artificial intelligence does not have unwelcome consequences  coordinating  a series of workshops  this year aimed at exploring its potential effects. Some ethical conundrums involving AI will be more complex to resolve than others. For instance  it may prove challenging to devise systems that take differing ethical perspectives into account. This issue has been raised  in a largely theoretical way  concerning the  behavior of self-driving cars . How to make AI systems more transparent and accountable is also an open question  and one that may itself require progress in the technology (see    AI  s Language Problem   Ã¹). The idea for the partnership emerged at an event coordinated in New York this January by Facebook to discuss ethical issues surrounding AI. Other companies and organizations involved in developing AI  such as Apple and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence  have discussed becoming involved in the effort in some capacity  the founding members say. Oren Etzioni  CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence  says it will be important for the organization to broach the issue of how AI may take away jobs. And he adds that the biggest challenge may be finding a way for competitors to work together effectively.     Ã£These are some of the leading high-tech companies  Ã£ in the world  he says.   They will need work together here.  Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics Are Face Recognition Systems Accurate? Depends on Your Race. The available evidence suggests that face matching systems don  t work equally well for different races. by     Mike Orcutt Jul 6  2016 Everything we know about the face recognition systems the FBI and police use suggests the software has a built-in racial bias. That isn  t on purpose  it  s an artifact of how the systems are designed  and the data they are trained on. But it is problematic. Law enforcement agencies are relying more and more on such tools to aid in criminal investigations  increasing the risk that something could go wrong. Law enforcement agencies haven  t provided many details on how they use facial recognition systems  but in June the Government Accountability Office issued a report saying that the FBI has not properly tested the accuracy of its face matching system  nor that of  the massive network of state-level face matching databases  it can access. And while state-of-the-art face matching systems can be nearly 95 percent accurate on mugshot databases  those photos are taken under controlled conditions with generally coâ\\x88\\x9aâ\\x88\\x82perative subjects. Images taken under less-than-ideal circumstances  like bad lighting  or that capture unusual poses and facial expressions  can lead to errors. Illustration by Sophia Foster-Dimino The algorithms can also be biased due to the way they are trained   says  Anil Jain   head of the biometrics research group at Michigan State University. To work  face matching software must first learn to recognize faces using training data  a set of images that gives the software information about how faces differ. If a gender  age group  or race is underrepresented in the training data  that will be reflected in the algorithm  s performance  says Jain. In 2012  Jain and several colleagues used a set of mugshots from the Pinellas County Sheriff  s Office in Florida to examine the performance of several commercially available face recognition systems  including ones from vendors that supply law enforcement agencies. The algorithms were  consistently less accurate  on women  African-Americans  and younger people. Apparently they were trained on data that was not representative enough of those groups  says Jain.   If your training set is strongly biased toward a particular race  your algorithm will do better recognizing that race  says  Alice O  Toole   head of the face perception research lab at University of Texas at Dallas. O  Toole and several colleagues  found in 2011  that an algorithm developed in Western countries was better at recognizing Caucasian faces than it was at recognizing East Asian faces. Likewise  East Asian algorithms performed better on East Asian faces than on Caucasian ones. In the several years since these studies  the accuracy of commercial algorithms has improved significantly in many areas  and Jain says the performance gaps between different genders and races may have narrowed. But so little testing information is available  it is hard to know. Newer approaches to face recognition  such as the deep learning systems Google and Facebook have developed  can make the same sort of mistakes if the training data is imbalanced  he says. Jonathon Phillips  an electronic engineer at the National Institute of Standards and Technology  conducts performance tests of commercial algorithms. He says that it  s possible to design a test to measure racial bias in face matching systems. In fact  privacy experts have  called for  making such tests a requirement. The FBI and MorphoTrust  the vendor that supplies the bureau  s face recognition software  did not answer e-mailed questions from  MIT Technology Review  regarding whether they test their algorithms   performance by race  gender  or age. The arrangements between vendors and the many state law enforcement agencies using face recognition are also not clear. But Pete Langenfeld  manager of digital analysis and identification for the Michigan State Police  says his organization does not test for group-specific accuracy. He said he does not know if the vendor that supplied the technology performs such tests either  but added that it is proprietary information  and the company isn  t required to release that information.  Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning An AI with 30 Years   Worth of Knowledge Finally Goes to Work An effort to encode the world  s knowledge in a huge database has sometimes seemed impractical  but those behind the technology say it is finally ready. by     Will Knight Mar 14  2016 Having spent the past 31 years memorizing an astonishing collection of general knowledge  the artificial-intelligence engine created by Doug Lenat is finally ready to go to work. Lenat  s creation is  Cyc   a knowledge base of semantic information designed to give computers some understanding of how things work in the real world. Cyc has been given many thousands of facts  including lots of information that you wouldn  t find in an encyclopedia because it seems self-evident. It knows  for example  that that Sir Isaac Newton is a famous historical figure who is no longer alive. But more important  Cyc also understands that if you let go of an apple it will fall to the ground; that an apple is not bigger than a person; and that a person cannot throw an apple into space. And now  after years of work  Lenat  s system is being commercialized by a company called  Lucid .   Part of the reason is the doneness of Cyc  explains Lenat  who left his post as a professor at Stanford to start the project in late 1984.   Not that there  s nothing else to do  he says. But he notes that most of what is left to be added is relevant to a specific area of expertise  such as finance or oncology. Among other projects  the company is developing a personal assistant equipped with Cyc  s general knowledge. This could perhaps lead to something similar to Siri but less predisposed to foolish misunderstandings. Michael Stewart  a longtime collaborator of Lenat  s and the CEO of Lucid  says the new company is in talks with various others interested in using the Cyc knowledge base. Lucid has been  working with the Cleveland Clinic   for example  to help automate the process of finding patients for clinical studies. This involved adding new information to the Cyc knowledge base and a new front-end interface that allows doctors to input natural-language queries such as   Find patients with bacteria after a pericardial window. Lucid should not only find the right candidate patients but provide a clear chain of logical reasoning for why it selected them. Stewart says the company is also working with banks and financial firms to develop similar solutions for uncovering investment insights and insider trading. The system was able to spot one potential case of insider dealing when it learned  from an organizational chart  that two people had sat next to each other several years earlier. It understood that if two people sit next to each other  that means they know each other. In each case  the AI faces a small learning curve.   We interview subject-matter experts  and also peruse documentation of the company  or medical-history documents  Stewart says.   We ingest that knowledge into Cyc much like you would with a human. The fact that Cyc is now being commercialized might raise a few eyebrows. The project has spent so long in gestation that it has often seemed as though it might never reach the market (see    The Cost of Common Sense   Ã¹). Besides  hard-coding rules and logic into an AI is quite an old-fashioned approach. In recent years  machine learning and especially neural networks have come to dominate the field  thanks to sudden leaps in performance made possible by better algorithms  more powerful hardware  and huge amounts of training data (see    10 Breakthrough Technologies 2013: Deep Learning   Ã¹). Google  s impressive Go-playing program AlphaGo  for example  mastered the impossibly complex and abstract game using various machine-learning tricks (see    Google  s AI Is Battering One of the World  s Top Go Players in Style   Ã¹). But deep learning is not good at imbuing machines with anything like common sense  which many see as an important shortcoming. Lenat certainly believes that advances in machine learning and deep learning will be flawed without some hand-coded knowledge.   It  s fine to say we  ll have programs that excel at checkers and chess and Go  he says.   But that  s very different from saying those programs will be able to have prolonged conversations that cause you to make decisions involving human life. Gary Marcus   a professor of psychology and neural science at New York University and the cofounder of an AI company called Geometric Intelligence  says Lucid is interesting because it aims to address some of the shortcomings of popular approaches.   Cyc has a reputation for being unwieldy  and for the last decade hardly anything has been said about it publicly  Marcus says.   At the same time  it represents an approach that is very different from all the deep-learning stuff that has been in the news. Marcus agrees that recent advances  which have enabled computers to process images and audio with human-like skills  are somewhat limited.   Deep learning is mainly about perception  he says    but there is a lot of inference involved in everyday human reasoning  and Cyc represents a serious effort to grapple with the subtlety of that inference. I don  t know what will emerge  but I am eager to see.  Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning Will Machines Eliminate Us? People who worry that we  re on course to invent dangerously intelligent machines are misunderstanding the state of computer science. by     Will Knight Jan 29  2016 Yoshua Bengio Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning Will Machines Eliminate Us? People who worry that we  re on course to invent dangerously intelligent machines are misunderstanding the state of computer science. by     Will Knight Jan 29  2016 Yoshua Bengio Yoshua Bengio leads one of the world  s preâ\\x88\\x9aÂ´minent research groups developing a powerful AI technique known as deep learning. The startling capabilities that deep learning has given computers in recent years  from human-level voice recognition and image classification to basic conversational skills  have prompted warnings about the progress AI is making toward matching  or perhaps surpassing  human intelligence. Prominent figures such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have even cautioned that artificial intelligence could pose an existential threat to humanity. Musk and others are investing millions of dollars in researching the potential dangers of AI  as well as possible solutions. But the direst statements sound overblown to many of the people who are actually developing the technology. Bengio  a professor of computer science at the University of Montreal  put things in perspective in an interview with  MIT Technology Review   s senior editor for AI and robotics  Will Knight. This story is part of our     March/April 2016     issue See the rest of the issue Subscribe Should we worry about how quickly artificial intelligence is advancing? There are people who are grossly overestimating the progress that has been made. There are many  many years of small progress behind a lot of these things  including mundane things like more data and computer power. The hype isn  t about whether the stuff we  re doing is useful or not  it is. But people underestimate how much more science needs to be done. And it  s difficult to separate the hype from the reality because we are seeing these great things and also  to the naked eye  they look magical. Is there a risk that AI researchers might accidentally   unleash the demon  as Musk has put it? It  s not like somebody found some magical recipe suddenly. Things are much more complicated than the simple story some people would like to tell. Journalists would sometimes like to tell the story that someone in their garage will have this amazing idea  and then we have a breakthrough and have AI. Similarly  companies want to tell a nice little story that   Oh  we have this revolutionary technology that  s going to change the world  AI is almost here  and we are the company that  s going to deliver it. That  s not at all how it works.   We  re missing something big. We  ve been making pretty fast progress  but it  s still not at the level where we would say the machine understands. We are still far from that. What about the idea  central to these concerns  that AI could somehow start improving itself and then become difficult to control? It  s not how AI is built these days. Machine learning means you have a painstaking  slow process of acquiring information through millions of examples. A machine improves itself  yes  but very  very slowly  and in very specialized ways. And the kind of algorithms we play with are not at all like little virus things that are self-programming. That  s not what we  re doing. What are some of the big unsolved problems with AI? Unsupervised learning is really  really important. Right now  the way we  re teaching machines to be intelligent is that we have to tell the computer what is an image  even at the pixel level. For autonomous driving  humans label huge numbers of images of cars to show which parts are pedestrians or roads. It  s not at all how humans learn  and it  s not how animals learn. We  re missing something big. This is one of the main things we  re doing in my lab  but there are no short-term applications  it  s probably not going to be useful to build a product tomorrow. Another big challenge is natural language understanding. We  ve been making pretty fast progress in the past few years  so it  s very encouraging. But it  s still not at the level where we would say the machine understands. That would be when we could read a paragraph and then ask any question about it  and the machine would basically answer in a reasonable way  as a human would. We are still far from that. What approaches beyond deep learning will be needed to create a true machine intelligence? Traditional endeavors  including reasoning and logic  we need to marry these things with deep learning in order to move toward AI. I  m one of the few people who think that machine learning people  and especially deep learning people  should pay more attention to neuroscience. Brains work  and we still don  t know why in many ways. Improving that understanding has a great potential to help AI research. And I think that neuroscience people would gain a lot from keeping track of what we do and trying to fit what they observe of the brain with the kinds of concepts we are developing in machine learning. Did you ever think you  d have to explain to people that AI isn  t about to take over the world? That must be odd. It  s certainly a new concern. For so many years  AI has been a disappointment. As researchers we fight to make the machine slightly more intelligent  but they are still so stupid. I used to think we shouldn  t call the field artificial intelligence but artificial stupidity. Really  our machines are dumb  and we  re just trying to make them less dumb. Now  because of these advances that people can see with demos  now we can say    Oh  gosh  it can actually say things in English  it can understand the contents of an image. Well  now we connect these things with all the science fiction we  ve seen and it  s like    Oh  I  m afraid! Okay  but surely it  s still important to think now about the eventual consequences of AI. Absolutely. We ought to be talking about these things. The thing I  m more worried about  in a foreseeable future  is not computers taking over the world. I  m more worried about misuse of AI. Things like bad military uses  manipulating people through really smart advertising; also  the social impact  like many people losing their jobs. Society needs to get together and come up with a collective response  and not leave it to the law of the jungle to sort things out.  Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning Could AI Solve the World  s Biggest Problems? Advances in machine-learning techniques have opened up a wealth of promising opportunities for AI applications  but some tech executives are thinking about ways it can make the world a better place. by     Will Knight Jan 12  2016 Are we on the verge of creating artificial intelligence capable of finding answers to the world  s most pressing challenges? After steady progress in basic AI tasks in recent years  this is the vision that some leading technologists have for AI. And yet  how we will make this grand leap is anyone  s guess. Eric Schmidt  the executive chairman of Alphabet (formerly Google)  says AI could be harnessed to help solve major challenges  including climate change and food security. Speaking at an event convened in New York this week to discuss the opportunities and risks in AI  Schmidt offered no details on how the technology might be adapted for such complex and abstract problems. Demis Hassabis  CEO of Google Deepmind  a division within Google doing groundbreaking work in machine learning  and which aims to bring about an   artificial general intelligence (see    Google  s Intelligence Designer   Ã¹)  said the goal of this effort was to harness AI for grand challenges.   If we can solve intelligence in a general enough way  then we can apply it to all sorts of things to make the world a better place  he said. And the chief technology officer of Facebook  Mike Schroepfer  expressed similar hope.   The power of AI technology is it can solve problems that scale to the whole planet  he said.  Eric Schmidt A steady stream of advances  mostly enabled by the latest machine-learning techniques  are indeed empowering computers to do ever more things  from recognizing the contents of images to holding short text or voice conversations. These advances seem destined to change the way computers are used in many industries  but it  s far from clear how the industry will go from captioning images to tackling poverty and climate change. In fact  speaking after his talk  Schroepfer was eager to limit expectations  at least in the short term. Schroepfer said that recent advances were not enough to allow machines to reach human levels of intelligence  and that two dozen or more   major breakthroughs would be needed before this happened. And he said many people apparently had the wrong idea about how rapidly the field was moving.   People see one cool example  and then extrapolate from that  he said. The event  organized by New York University as well as companies leading the effort to harness artificial intelligence  including Facebook and Google  comes at a delicate moment for academic researchers and companies riding the wave of progress in AI. Progress seems certain to revolutionize many industries  perhaps with negative consequences  such as eradicating certain jobs (see    Who Will Own the Robots ?  Ã¹). It will surely also raise new ethical questions  such as the legal and moral liability in self-driving cars  or the implications of autonomous weapons (see    How to Help Self-Driving Cars Make Ethical Decisions   Ã¹). But the impressive progress has inspired some within the field of AI (as well as a few outside it) to pontificate about the long-term implications of the technology. Sometimes this discussion has focused on the challenge of controlling AI should it become vastly more powerful and independent  something that is very far from possible today. Worries over the long-term risks of AI recently inspired the foundation of a new nonprofit called  OpenAI  dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence that benefits humanity (see    What Will It Take to Build a Virtuous AI ?  Ã¹). OpenAI is funded by a billion-dollar grant from Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk  who has been outspoken about the long-term dangers of AI  and other technology heavyweights. Hassabis and several others acknowledged that the ethical issues should be taken seriously.   As with any technology  if it  s going to be that powerful  we have to think about how to use it ethically and responsibly  he said.  Intelligent Machines What Will It Take to Build a Virtuous AI? A billion-dollar nonprofit backed by Silicon Valley heavyweights aims to make machines more moral. How it will do so isn  t yet clear. by     Will Knight Dec 15  2015 A billion dollars is quite a lot of money to invest  even if your goal is saving the world from the ill effects of super-smart artificial intelligence that humans can  t control. That  s the amount of cash several big-name entrepreneurs  including Elon Musk  Peter Thiel  and Sam Altman of  Y Combinator    have committed to investing  in  OpenAI   a new nonprofit aimed at developing artificial intelligence that   benefits humanity (see    A Billion-Dollar Effort to Make a Kinder AI   Ã¹). The idea is this: without answering to either academia or industry  OpenAI will be better able to consider the ethical implications of the technology it is creating. OpenAI isn  t the first nonprofit dedicated to furthering artificial intelligence  and Google  Facebook  and others have taken steps to make some of the AI technology they are developing freely available (see    Facebook Joins the Stampede to Give Away Artificial Intelligence Technology   Ã¹). However  OpenAI has attracted a large amount of attention already  both because of the big names involved and because of its lofty and futuristic goals. It might seem like a worthwhile and sensible endeavor. After all  many AI experts believe it  s worth considering the implications of technology that is becoming ever more powerful and disruptive. However  some important questions remain to be answered. It is not clear how the billion dollars invested in OpenAI will be spent  or over what time frame. Nor is it evident how the organization  s ethical objectives will be squared with the basic work of building AI algorithms. Perhaps most confusing of all  it  s difficult to imagine how the ethical goals that would be programmed into future AIs might be agreed upon.   I  d agree that AI is a very powerful tool  and some designs and uses can be better or worse than others  says  Patrick Lin   a philosopher at Cal Poly who studies the ethics of automation and artificial intelligence. But  he adds:   OpenAI says that it aims at   a good outcome for all   and to   benefit humanity as a whole    but who gets to define what the good outcome is? Lin notes that some of those backing OpenAI are known for their libertarian views  which may not align with the public at large. And he points to Tesla  s decision to beta-test its self-driving technology on the public roads as ethically questionable. Lin also says that simply removing a financial incentive does not necessarily eradicate the potential for things to go wrong. Others  especially those who are already worried about the long-term implications of the technology they are developing  are more encouraging.   I  m enthusiastic about the initiative   Eric Horvitz   technical fellow and managing director of Microsoft Research in Redmond  Washington  who has long been interested in discussing the long-term implications of AI.   I hope that Microsoft Research and Microsoft more broadly will be able to assist Elon and Sam and others  and to collaborate with folks at OpenAI. In 2009  as president of the  Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence   Horvitz convened a conference to explore the long-term impact of AI. And last year he founded an academic effort to explore this issue: the  One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence  at Stanford University.   It is not only about aligning preferences and making sure that systems do the right thing  Horvitz says    but also about their ability to understand when they must reach out to people for assistance when they are confused. Oren Etzioni   chief executive officer of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence  another nonprofit  is similarly positive about the announcement.   I think everybody thinks this is a good thing  he says.   The people involved are exceptionally talented. The OpenAI announcement certainly comes at a remarkable moment in the rebirth of AI. There has been rapid and sometimes startling progress  especially using a technique based on neural networks  known as deep learning (see    10 Breakthrough Technologies: Deep Learning   Ã¹)  in building algorithms enabling machines to perform tasks that previously eluded them  including recognizing the contents of images  understanding spoken words  and parsing basic text. The founding of OpenAI also follows a series of warnings  from Musk and others  over the potential long-term implications of artificial intelligence  fueled in part by speculation about the difficulty of controlling an AI capable of superhuman intelligence and ingenuity. Much of this seems to have been inspired by a book called  Superintelligence: Paths  Dangers  Strategies  written by  Nick Bostrom   a philosopher and director of the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford. Bostrom  s book contains many troubling thought experiments about future AI. Some caution that these long-term fears should not outweigh more pressing concerns  such as the impact of AI on employment or legal situations.   I would definitely be thinking about the social and economic consequences of AI now  says Etzioni.   These other  more far-fetched questions of whether AI is an existential threat  I  m worried that they could be an unwelcome distraction. The new nonprofit certainly won  t lack for technical expertise. It will be led by research director Ilya Sutskever  who was a student of the deep-learning pioneer Geoffrey Hinton and most recently worked at Google  after it acquired the company he cofounded with Hinton (see    Innovators Under 35: Ilya Sutskever   Ã¹). The OpenAI project has not yet stated how its moral objectives will change the machine-learning techniques that Sutskever and others are developing. Some technical experts say this isn  t an insurmountable challenge.   I actually don  t think it  s that hard to encode ethical considerations into machine learning algorithms as part of the objective function that they optimize  says  Pedro Domingos   a professor at Washington University and the author of the recent book  The Master Algorithm . However  he notes:   The big question is whether we human beings are able to formalize our ethical beliefs in a halfway coherent and complete way. Another option is to have the AIs learn ethics by observing our behavior  but I have a feeling they could wind up pretty confused if they did. However OpenAI chooses to program morality into its algorithms  Lin argues that the issue should be opened up for greater debate.   Society should have some input into what a good outcome should be  especially for a game-changing technology such as AI  he says.   Without broader input  they  ll be unlikely to get it right.  Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning The Hit Charade An algorithm might create a playlist you enjoy  but don  t mistake that for creativity. by     Will Knight Sep 22  2015 Zane Lowe  s first show as a DJ on Apple Music was a bit dizzying. The songs he played lurched from punk-pop to post-rock to grime to electronica to stadium rock and beyond. He showcased previously unheard songs along with tracks recorded decades ago by well-known rockers. Yet despite the disarray  or probably because of it  I enjoyed the show. Each new track took me in a surprising direction  while the mix of artists and the energy of the songs seemed to match Lowe  s slightly deranged chatter. This story is part of our     November/December 2015     issue See the rest of the issue Subscribe One thing that stands out about Apple Music  a streaming service you can use on computers and mobile devices for $10 a month  is the presence of human DJs like Lowe on a channel called Beats 1. Lowe  s show introduced me to unfamiliar artists  and it highlighted intriguing musical connections  between  say  a stadium anthem by AC/DC and a recent piece of remixed electronica by a Scottish artist called Hudson Mohawke. The emotion running through all the songs was upbeat  even defiant. Just as computers cannot yet create powerful and imaginative art or prose  they cannot truly appreciate music. And arranging a poignant or compelling music playlist takes a type of insight they don  t have  the ability to find similarities in musical elements and to get the emotional resonance and cultural context of songs. For all the progress being made in artificial intelligence  machines are still hopelessly unimaginative and predictable. This is why Apple has hired hundreds of people to serve as DJs and playlist makers  in addition to the algorithmic recommendations it still offers. Pandora  s choices tend to be rather predictable  often just as bland and conventional as those on commercial radio. Bringing in human experts is a clever way for Apple to differentiate itself. Despite having pioneered the digital distribution and storage of music  it now finds itself lagging behind streaming services such as Pandora  Spotify  Rdio  and Tidal. None of these emphasize curation by human experts as much as Apple Music does. And while the algorithms that all these companies use for recommending songs have improved greatly in recent years  there  s no real musical understanding or appreciation going on. It shows. The algorithms employ statistical techniques to parse listener data  making an educated guess as to what you might like. There is still no algorithm that can account for human taste. Hearing things Pandora  one of the first music streaming services  is a good example of the algorithmic approach. Through a decade-old effort called the Music Genome Project  Pandora has employed music experts to tag songs with hundreds of characteristics  such as the genre  the types of instruments used  and even the melodic phrasing and tonality. When you give Pandora a band  composer  or song as a starting point  it creates a   radio station of music with similar attributes. Choose the Beatles  and Pandora may automatically cue up a song by the Beach Boys  informing you    We  re playing this track because it features mellow rock instrumentation  demanding vocal performances  interweaving vocal harmony  mixed minor & major key tonality  and melodic songwriting. Sadly  Pandora  s choices tend to be rather predictable  often just as bland and conventional as those on commercial radio. After beginning with the Beatles  you  re unlikely to hear a song in a very different style that was popular around the same time  for example  or a hip-hop artist who  s done a clever job sampling the work of Ringo and co. More recently  algorithms have begun producing playlists that can feel a lot more nuanced and tailor-made. The world  s biggest streaming service  Spotify  which has more than 75 million users  is pushing the state of the art  using vast amounts of data to make personalized recommendations. Things Reviewed Apple Music Pandora Spotify   Creativity  the Turing Test  and the (Better) Lovelace Test By Selmer Bringsjord  Paul Bello  and David Ferrucci Mind and Machines  vol. 11  2001 Chris Johnson  who leads one of Spotify  s data science teams in New York  says the company does employ humans to make some of its playlists. But it also collects as much data as possible on a user  s listening behavior  and then compares it with data collected from other users. The idea behind this technique  known as collaborative filtering  is that you  ll probably like a song that someone with similar tastes has already discovered and enjoyed. Last year  Spotify acquired a company called the Echo Nest that gathers information about new music posted to blogs  news websites  and social media. These opinions also now feed into Spotify  s recommendations  helping to make its music suggestions cleverer still. In July  Spotify began testing a personalized playlist made available this way.   We look at what you  re playing  playlists you  re creating  and basically everything we know about you. From that  every Monday  there  s going to be this new playlist of music  Johnson told me. The first few playlists I received included several songs that I instantly loved  though none stray very far beyond the stuff I already listen to. It  s useful  but not quite mind-blowing. There is an inherent limitation to such automated recommendation algorithms  too: they cannot suggest a new song  because there  s no data to show how much other listeners like it. In contrast to an algorithm  humans can usually tell  within a few moments of listening  just how much they like a new track. Here  though  recent advances in artificial intelligence are starting to help. Last year  Â¬â\\x89\\xa0Spotify began testing a way of analyzing a song itself rather than just the metadata associated with it. This involved training what  s known as a deep-learning network  roughly modeled on layers of neurons in the brain  to recognize frequency features of an audio signal (corresponding to the sound you hear and the way that sound changes over time) in millions of songs. These algorithms can classify a new song surprisingly well  as shown in example  playlists posted  by a member of Johnson  s team at Spotify. Human expertise will remain a key part of Spotify  s algorithms for the foreseeable future. But even this feat is not evidence of real musical understanding or judgment. Spotify  s deep-learning system still has to be trained using millions of example songs  and it would be perplexed by a bold new style of music. What  s more  such algorithms cannot arrange songs in a creative way. Nor can they distinguish between a truly original piece and yet another me-too imitation of a popular sound. Johnson acknowledges this limitation  and he says human expertise will remain a key part of Spotify  s algorithms for the foreseeable future. Apple  s Beats 1 offers a vastly different experience. One radio show   The Alligator Hour   which is fronted by the musician and producer Joshua Homme  celebrates obscure but extremely original songs. It also revels in the absurd connections that can be found between some songs  pairing  for instance  the melodic side of the Sex Pistols with the adrenaline that fuels Donna Summer  s disco. It  s delightfully weird. In another show  called  Mixtape Delivery Service  the musician Annie Clark (stage name St. Vincent) plays a custom list of songs inspired by one listener  s mood or situation. In her first show  Clark arranged a retrospective of less well known but culturally significant dance music for an 11-year-old girl who wanted to learn more about the genre. Auditory Turing test What is it that gives people this ability? Could deep learning or other artificial-intelligence systems ever develop   taste that goes beyond classifying the characteristics of a song to determine whether it is   good or not? Might computers be able to identify that intangible quality that people naturally associate with talent or creativity or originality? When I asked Johnson if an algorithm might someday be able to scout out a hit song from an unsigned artist  he said:   That  s exactly what we want to do. It  s a bold ambition  and one that might prove elusive. Musical appreciation and creativity have nothing to do with finding statistical patterns in great piles of data.   What differentiates something unusual or bizarre from something creative? That  s a difficult question  says Eyal Reingold  a psychologist at the University of Toronto who studies human creativity. For a machine to demonstrate creativity  he says    it would have to produce something that  s not only unusual  or something that  s not been programmed into it  but that is judged to be useful  at least in some cultural context. Indeed  the slippery nature of creativity has led some psychologists and computer scientists to suggest that it could be a useful way to measure machine intelligence. In a paper published in 2001  two academics from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute  together with David Ferrucci  then an IBM researcher who would go on to create a computer called Watson that would win the game show  Jeopardy!   argued that a creativity test could be a better way to judge whether a computer had achieved human-type intelligence. They noted that the test proposed in 1950 by Alan Turing  which gauges a machine  s intelligence through a typed conversation  encourages programmers to employ trickery rather than build something genuinely intelligent. They reasoned that feats of creativity  whether in painting  writing  music  or some other field  are much harder to fake and are fundamental to intelligence. And they called their alternative the Lovelace test  after Ada Lovelace  often considered the world  s first computer programmer  who noted in 1843 that the first computing machines  impressive though they might be  would be incapable of doing anything original. Tellingly  efforts to pass the Lovelace test have largely foundered. Still  the challenge lives on. In fact   Michael Casey   a professor of music and computer science at Dartmouth College  plans to hold several Turing tests early next year  perhaps followed by some Lovelace tests. One will involve computer DJs  with dancers asked to judge whether the songs they just heard were cued up by a human or by a machine. Casey hopes that within this limited context  a machine will demonstrate something akin to musical creativity. He hardly seems confident  though.   No matter what type of algorithm we  ve tried to apply in the past to music  whether it  s something that tries to mimic Bach or Mozart  or tries to recommend music  at a certain point it feels like it doesn  t have any  Ã\\x84Ã²shape   to it  he says  a little ruefully.   It may  for a few seconds  fool you  but it doesn  t have an overall plan. And I think the same may be true of an automated DJ set. Perhaps this will be true for a long while yet. And if we want machines to come up with something as unique and original as a show on Apple  s Beats 1  then we might need to think a little more creatively about how we design them.  Artificial Intelligence  /  Robots Military Robots: Armed  but How Dangerous? The debate over using artificial intelligence to control lethal weapons in warfare is more complex than it seems. by     Will Knight Aug 3  2015 An  open letter  calling for a ban on lethal weapons controlled by artificially intelligent machines was signed last week by thousands of scientists and technologists  reflecting growing concern that swift progress in artificial intelligence could be harnessed to make killing machines more efficient  and less accountable  both on the battlefield and off. But experts are more divided on the issue of robot killing machines than you might expect. The letter  presented at the  International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence  in Buenos Aires  Argentina  was signed by many leading AI researchers as well as prominent scientists and entrepreneurs including Elon Musk  Stephen Hawking  and Steve Wozniak. The letter states:   Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has reached a point where the deployment of such systems is  practically if not legally  feasible within years not decades  and the stakes are high: autonomous weapons have been described as the third revolution in warfare  after gunpowder and nuclear arms. Rapid advances have indeed been made in artificial intelligence in recent years  especially within the field of machine learning  which involves teaching computers to recognize often complex or subtle patterns in large quantities of data. And this is leading to ethical questions about real-world applications of the technology (see    How to Make Self-Driving Cars Make Ethical Decisions   Ã¹). Meanwhile  military technology has advanced to allow actions to be taken remotely  for example using drone aircraft or bomb disposal robots  raising the prospect that those actions could be automated. The issue of automating lethal weapons has been a concern for scientists as well as military and policy experts for some time. In 2012  the U.S. Department of Defense issued a  directive  banning the development and use of   autonomous and semi-autonomous weapons for 10 years. Earlier this year the United Nations held a meeting to discuss the issue of lethal automated weapons  and the possibility of such a ban. But while military drones or robots could well become more automated  some say the idea of fully independent machines capable carrying out lethal missions without human assistance is more fanciful. With many fundamental challenges still remaining in the field of artificial intelligence  however  it  s far from clear when the technology needed for fully autonomous weapons might actually arrive.   We  re pushing new frontiers in artificial intelligence  says  Patrick Lin   a professor of philosophy at California Polytechnic State University.   And a lot of people are rightly skeptical that it would ever advance to the point where it has anything called full autonomy. No one is really an expert on predicting the future. Lin  who gave evidence at the recent U.N. meeting  adds that the letter does not touch on the complex ethical debate behind the use of automation in weapons systems.   The letter is useful in raising awareness  he says     but it isn  t so much calling for debate; it  s trying to end the debate  saying   We  ve figured it out and you all need to go along.   Stuart Russell   a leading AI researcher and a professor at the University of California  Berkeley  dismisses this idea.   It  s simply not true that there has been no debate  he says.   But it is true that the AI and robotics communities have been mostly blissfully ignorant of this issue  maybe because their professional societies have ignored it. One issue of debate  which the letter does acknowledge  is that automated weapons could conceivably help reduce unwanted casualties in some situations  since they would be less prone to error  fatigue  or emotion than human combatants. Those behind the letter have little time for this argument  however. Max Tegmark   an MIT physicist and founder member of the  Future of Life Institute   which coâ\\x88\\x9aâ\\x88\\x82rdinated the letter signing  says the idea of ethical automated weapons is a red herring.   I think it  s rather irrelevant  frankly  he says.   It  s missing the big point about what is this going to lead to if one starts this AI arms race. If you make the assumption that only the U.S. is going to build these weapons  and the number of conflicts will stay exactly the same  then it would be relevant. The Future of Life Institute has issued a more general warning about the long-term risks posed by unfettered AI  cautioning that it could pose serious dangers in the future.    This is quite a different issue  Russell says.   Although there is a connection  in that if one is worried about losing control over AI systems as they become smarter  maybe it  s not a good idea to turn over our defense systems to them. While many AI experts seem to share this broad concern  some see it as a little misplaced. For example   Gary Marcus   a cognitive scientist and artificial intelligence researcher at New York University  has  argued  that computers do not need to become artificially intelligent in order to pose many other serious risks  to financial markets or air-traffic systems  for example. Lin says that while the concept of unchecked killer robots is obviously worrying  the issue of automated weapons deserves a more nuanced discussion.   Emotionally  it  s a pretty straightforward case  says Lin.   Intellectually I think they need to do more work.  Tech Policy  /  AI Ethics How to Help Self-Driving Cars Make Ethical Decisions Researchers are trying to program self-driving cars to make split-second decisions that raise real ethical questions. by     Will Knight Jul 29  2015 A philosopher is perhaps the last person you  d expect to have a hand in designing your next car  but that  s exactly what one expert on self-driving vehicles has in mind. Chris Gerdes   a professor at Stanford University  leads a research lab that is experimenting with sophisticated hardware and software for automated driving. But together with  Patrick Lin   a professor of philosophy at Cal Poly  he is also exploring the ethical dilemmas that may arise when vehicle self-driving is deployed in the real world. Gerdes and Lin organized a workshop at Stanford earlier this year that brought together philosophers and engineers to discuss the issue. They implemented different ethical settings in the software that controls automated vehicles and then tested the code in simulations and even in real vehicles. Such settings might  for example  tell a car to prioritize avoiding humans over avoiding parked vehicles  or not to swerve for squirrels. Illustration by Victor Kerlow Fully self-driving vehicles are still at the research stage  but automated driving technology is rapidly creeping into vehicles. Over the next couple of years  a number of carmakers plan to release vehicles capable of steering  accelerating  and braking for themselves on highways for extended periods. Some cars already feature sensors that can detect pedestrians or cyclists  and warn drivers if it seems they might hit someone. So far  self-driving cars have been involved in very few accidents. Google  s automated cars have covered nearly a million miles of road with just a few rear-enders  and these vehicles typically deal with uncertain situations by simply stopping (see    Google  s Self-Driving Car Chief Defends Safety Record   Ã¹). As the technology advances  however  and cars become capable of interpreting more complex scenes  automated driving systems may need to make split-second decisions that raise real ethical questions. At a recent industry event  Gerdes gave an example of one such scenario: a child suddenly dashing into the road  forcing the self-driving car to choose between hitting the child or swerving into an oncoming van.   As we see this with human eyes  one of these obstacles has a lot more value than the other  Gerdes said.   What is the car  s responsibility? Gerdes pointed out that it might even be ethically preferable to put the passengers of the self-driving car at risk.   If that would avoid the child  if it would save the child  s life  could we injure the occupant of the vehicle? These are very tough decisions that those that design control algorithms for automated vehicles face every day  he said. Gerdes called on researchers  automotive engineers  and automotive executives at the event to prepare to consider the ethical implications of the technology they are developing.   You  re not going to just go and get the ethics module  and plug it into your self-driving car  he said. Other experts agree that there will be an important ethical dimension to the development of automated driving technology.   When you ask a car to make a decision  you have an ethical dilemma  says Adriano Alessandrini  a researcher working on automated vehicles at the University de Roma La Sapienza  in Italy.   You might see something in your path  and you decide to change lanes  and as you do  something else is in that lane. So this is an ethical dilemma. Alessandrini leads a project called  CityMobil2   which is testing automated transit vehicles in various Italian cities. These vehicles are far simpler than the cars being developed by Google and many carmakers; they simply follow a route and brake if something gets in the way. Alessandrini believes this may make the technology easier to launch.   We don  t have this [ethical] problem  he says. Others believe the situation is a little more complicated. For example   Bryant Walker-Smith   an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina who studies the legal and social implications of self-driving vehicles  says plenty of ethical decisions are already made in automotive engineering.   Ethics  philosophy  law: all of these assumptions underpin so many decisions  he says.   If you look at airbags  for example  inherent in that technology is the assumption that you  re going to save a lot of lives  and only kill a few. Walker-Smith adds that  given the number of fatal traffic accidents that involve human error today  it could be considered unethical to introduce self-driving technology too slowly.   The biggest ethical question is how quickly we move. We have a technology that potentially could save a lot of people  but is going to be imperfect and is going to kill.  Artificial Intelligence  /  Robots What It Will Take for Computers to Be Conscious The world  s best-known consciousness researcher says machines could one day become self-aware. by     Antonio Regalado Oct 2  2014 Is a worm conscious? How about a bumblebee? Does a computer that can play chess   feel anything? Christof Koch To Christof Koch  chief scientific officer of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle  the answer to these questions may lie in the fabric of the universe itself. Consciousness  he believes  is an intrinsic property of matter  just like mass or energy. Organize matter in just the right way  as in the mammalian brain  and  voilâ\\x88\\x9aâ\\x80\\xa0   you can feel. Koch  now 57  has spent nearly a quarter of a century trying to explain why  say  the sun feels warm on your face. But after writing  three books on consciousness   Koch says researchers are still far from knowing why it occurs  or even agreeing on what it is. It  s a difficult problem (see    Cracking the Brain  s Codes   Ã¹). That is one reason that Koch left his position at Caltech in 2011 to become part of a $500 million project launched by the billionaire Paul Allen  Microsoft  s cofounder. The Allen Institute  s goal is to build a detailed atlas of every neuron and synapse in the mammalian brain. That would give neuroscience a firehose of data similar to what the Human Genome Project achieved. But Koch hasn  t given up his search for a grand theory that could explain it all. In fact  he thinks consciousness could be explained by something called    integrated information theory   which asserts that consciousness is a product of structures  like the brain  that can both store a large amount of information and have a critical density of interconnections between their parts. To Koch  the theory provides a means to assess degrees of consciousness in people with brain damage  in species across the animal kingdom  and even  he says  among machines. We asked Koch about computer consciousness last week during  MIT Technology Review   s EmTech conference. Will discovering the biological basis of consciousness be dehumanizing in some way? What if it  s all just an illusion?  I find this view of some people that consciousness is an illusion to be ridiculous. If it  s an illusion  then it  s the most powerful illusion we have. I mean  the most famous deduction in Western philosophy is what?   I think. Therefore I am. The fact that you have conscious experience is the one undeniable certainty you have. If scientists discover the basis of consciousness  what kinds of technologies could result from that?  We could have a test to say who has consciousness and who doesn  t. We have very emotional debates in this country about abortion. I would like to have some objective way to test at what point a fetus actually begins to have conscious sensation. Or whether a patient [in a coma] is conscious or not. Often  you just don  t know. These are questions that people have asked since historic times  but once we have a theory  and a widely accepted theory  we could answer them. Also  if I wanted to build a machine that would be conscious  it would give me a blueprint. So you think a computer can be conscious?  I gave a lecture [last week] at MIT about Integrated Information Theory  developed by Giulio Tononi at the University of Wisconsin. This is a theory that makes a very clear prediction: it says that consciousness is a property of complex systems that have a particular   cause-effect repertoire. They have a particular way of interacting with the world  such as the brain does  or in principle  such as a computer could. If you were to build a computer that has the same circuitry as the brain  this computer would also have consciousness associated with it. It would feel like something to be this computer. However  the same is not true for digital simulations. If I build a perfect software model of the brain  it would never be conscious  but a specially designed machine that mimics the brain could be? Correct. This theory clearly says that a digital simulation would not be conscious  which is strikingly different from the dominant functionalist belief of 99 percent of people at MIT or philosophers like Daniel Dennett. They all say  once you simulate everything  nothing else is required  and it  s going to be conscious. I think consciousness  like mass  is a fundamental property of the universe. The analogy  and it  s a very good one  is that you can make pretty good weather predictions these days. You can predict the inside of a storm. But it  s never wet inside the computer. You can simulate a black hole in a computer  but space-time will not be bent. Simulating something is not the real thing. It  s the same thing with consciousness. In 100 years  you might be able to simulate consciousness on a computer. But it won  t experience anything. Nada. It will be black inside. It will have no experience whatsoever  even though it may have our intelligence and our ability to speak. I am not saying consciousness is a magic soul. It is something physical. Consciousness is always supervening onto the physical. But it takes a particular type of hardware to instantiate it. A computer made up of transistors  moving charge on and off a gate  with each gate being connected to a small number of other gates  is just a very different cause-and-effect structure than what we have in the brain  where you have one neuron connected to 10 000 input neurons and projecting to 10 000 other neurons. But if you were to build the computer in the appropriate way  like a neuromorphic computer [see    Thinking in Silicon   Ã¹]  it could be conscious. If I were to put you in a room with a computer from the future  would you be able to determine if it  s conscious?  I couldn  t from the outside. I would have to look at its hardware. What about the Turing test? The question Turing asked is    Can machines think ? But ultimately it  s an operational test for intelligence  not for consciousness. If you have a clever conversation with some guy in another room and after half an hour you can  t decide if it is a computer or a human  well  then you say it  s as intelligent as a human. But the Turing test would not tell me if the machine experiences anything. I could ask   Are you conscious? and the machine could say   Yes  I am fully conscious. And why are you claiming I am not? I am insulted. But I couldn  t really know. I  d have to say    Sorry  I have to take you apart and understand how you are made and how you actually generate these different physical states. Isn  t there some trick question you could ask  that only a conscious being could answer?  A very good question. In humans we have practical tests for consciousness. If you have a bad accident and go to the ER  they will ask you: Can you move your eyes? Can you move your limbs? Can you talk? If you can talk  do you know what year it is? Do you know who the president is? But how do I really know you are conscious? This is the problem of solipsism. In the last analysis I do not know. But I know your brain is very similar to mine. I have put a lot of people into scanners  and I know they all have a brain  and their brains behave similar to mine. So there is a perfectly reasonable inference that you too are conscious. But the more these systems differ from me  the more difficult it is to make that step by inference. For instance  take a bee. Does it feel like something to be a bee and fly in the golden sun rays and have nectar? I find it very difficult to know if a bee is conscious or not conscious. And a computer is even more radically different. There is no behavior I can judge it by. I would have to look at its underlying hardware. Do you think we will ever build conscious machines? I  m not sure why we would. But there is no question in my mind that we will build smart machines that can pass the Turing test well before we understand the true biological basis of human intelligence. And I think there are dangers associated with that which most people  being blithe optimists  completely ignore. What dangers? Don  t you watch science fiction movies?   Runaway AI of course. Think about the financial market  all those trading machines  flash crashes. People are going to abuse computer intelligence  blindly maximize for some goal. It  s going to lead to more and more concentration of power among fewer and fewer people. We see this already  it  s going to lead to massive unemployment. And maybe 30 or 40 years on I think there is really an existentialist danger to the species  at the level of nuclear weapons or a meteorite strike. All without the machine being conscious? In the movies  the moment the AI goes nuts is the same moment that it gains conscious self-awareness. That  s because people want to make an engaging story. If the enemy doesn  t feel anything  if there isn  t anything there  it doesn  t make a good opponent.  An Algorithm Trained on Emoji Knows When Youâ\\x80\\x99re Being Sarcastic on Twitter\\nUnderstanding sarcasm could help AI fight racism  abuse  and harassment.\\nby Will Knight\\nAug 3  2017\\n\\nScroll through Twitter and youâ\\x80\\x99ll find plenty of sarcastic commentsâ\\x80\\x94not to mention lots of cases where sarcasm apparently went straight over someoneâ\\x80\\x99s head.\\n\\nLuckily  an algorithm MIT researchers developed to analyze tweets can now detect sarcasm  and emotional subtext in general  better than most people.\\n\\nDetecting the sentiment of social-media posts is already useful for tracking attitudes toward brands and products  and for identifying signals that might indicate trends in the financial markets. But more accurately discerning the meaning of tweets and comments could help computers automatically spot and quash abuse and hate speech online. A deeper understanding of Twitter should also help academics understand how information and influence flows through the network. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s more  as machines become smarter  the ability to sense emotion could become an important feature of human-to-machine communication.\\nThe researchers originally aimed to develop a system capable of detecting racist posts on Twitter. But they soon realized that the meaning of many messages couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be properly understood without some understanding of sarcasm.\\n\\nThe algorithm uses deep learning  a popular machine-learning technique that relies on training a very large simulated neural network to recognize subtle patterns using a large amount of data. The secret to training this algorithm was that many tweets already use something like a labeling system for emotional content: emoji. Once they took advantage of this to help the system read tweets for emotion in general  the researchers had a head start in teaching it to recognize sarcasm.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause we canâ\\x80\\x99t use intonation in our voice or body language to contextualize what we are saying  emoji are the way we do it online â\\x80\\x9d says Iyad Rahwan  an associate professor the MIT Media lab who developed the algorithm with one of his students  Bjarke Felbo. â\\x80\\x9cThe neural network learned the connection between a certain kind of language and an emoji.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTo train the algorithm  dubbed DeepMoji  the researchers collected 55 billion tweets  and then selected 1.2 billion containing some combination of 64 popular emoji. First they trained the system to predict which emoji would be used with a particular message  depending on whether it was happy  sad  humorous  and so on. After that  the system was taught to identify sarcasm using an existing data set of labeled examples. The algorithm that had been pre-trained using emoji was far better at detecting sarcasm than one that hadnâ\\x80\\x99t. They will release the algorithm for anyone to use.\\n\\nTo see how good DeepMoji is  the researchers tested it against several benchmarks for sensing sentiment and emotion in text. They found that it performed far better than the best existing algorithms in each case.\\n\\nThey also tested it against humans  using volunteers recruited through the crowdsourcing site Mechanical Turk. They found it was better than the humans at spotting sarcasm and other emotions on Twitter. It was 82 percent accurate at identifying sarcasm correctly  compared with an average score of 76 percent for the human volunteers.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt might be that itâ\\x80\\x99s learning all the different slang â\\x80\\x9d Felbo says. â\\x80\\x9cPeople have very interesting uses of language [on Twitter]â\\x80\\x94letâ\\x80\\x99s put it that way.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe researchers have built a DeepMoji website to demonstrate the emoji part of the system. It will automatically append suitable emoji to a piece of text. It seems to work pretty well  although when I tried inputting Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s now-infamous â\\x80\\x9ccovfefeâ\\x80\\x9d tweet it was as confused as everyone else.\\n\\nThe site also lets users contribute to the research by annotating their own tweets with emotions. This is an important element of the work  Rahwan says. Usually researchers have volunteers tag other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s tweets or posts with perceived emotion  which provides a less direct measure. â\\x80\\x9cThese benchmarks donâ\\x80\\x99t capture what psychologists would consider true sentiment â\\x80\\x9d he says.\\n\\nGary King  director of the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard University and an expert on mining social networks for meaning  says using emoji as a means of training is a clever idea. But he questions how valuable it is to identify sarcasm if itâ\\x80\\x99s lost on most people. â\\x80\\x9cIf the sarcasm is so nuanced that a human reader would likely miss it  then it really doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter â\\x80\\x9d he says.\\n\\nNonetheless  the work reflects the fact that computers are gradually getting better at sensing human emotion. Sentiment analysis of text is already a widely used technique. For example  it can help companies determine from the contents of an e-mail or chat message if a customer is particularly irate.\\n\\nIt may become ever more common for computers to try to decipher our emotions. Imagine  perhaps  a robot coworker that understands when its human colleagues are getting frustratedâ\\x80\\x94or when they deliver a sarcastic compliment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf machines are going to cooperate with us  then theyâ\\x80\\x99re going to have to understand us  and emotion is really hard â\\x80\\x9d Rahwan says.\\n  Himabindu Lakkaraju\\n29\\nHarvard University\\nCountry of birth: India\\nHer AI program aims to weed out bias in decision making\\nby Erika Beras\\n\\nHimabindu Lakkaraju designed an artificial intelligence program that serve as a bias check for decision makers like judges and doctors.\\nMachine learning and AI are increasingly used in law enforcement to make decisions about which defendants get bail  in health care to determine medical treatments  and at financial institutions to determine who gets loans. But making decisions by automation can have pitfallsâ\\x80\\x94software can miss the nuance that a human may catch when looking at a criminal  medical  or credit record. But humans can also miss nuances and have their own biasesâ\\x80\\x94especially when theyâ\\x80\\x99re pressed for time and have to make life-altering decisions.\\nLakkarajuâ\\x80\\x99s system doesnâ\\x80\\x99t rely solely on human choices or on machine learning but uses a combination of the two. Most of her work deals with data sets in which she could see the expected outcomes from both AI and the human decision makers  and spot where bias might occur.\\nHer work is now being used by schools in Montgomery County  Maryland  to help them identify at-risk students and predict the likelihood that a child might need extra tutoring or mentoring.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSchool districts are often limited in their resourcesâ\\x80\\x94so knowing this likelihood will help the school districts assign those students to interventions who are most likely to benefit from them â\\x80\\x9d Lakkaraju says.  Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning\\nThe biggest threat of deepfakes isnâ\\x80\\x99t the deepfakes themselves\\nThe mere idea of AI-synthesized media is already making people stop believing that real things are real.\\nby Karen Hao\\nOct 10  2019\\n\\nIt was late 2018  and the people of Gabon hadnâ\\x80\\x99t seen their president  Ali Bongo  in public for months. Some began to suspect that he was ill  or even dead  and the government was covering it up. To stop the speculation  the government announced that Bongo had suffered a stroke but remained in good health. Soon after  it released a video of him delivering his customary New Yearâ\\x80\\x99s address.\\n\\nRather than assuaging tensions  however  the video did precisely the opposite. Many people  thinking Bongo looked off in the footage  immediately suspected it was a deepfakeâ\\x80\\x94a piece of media forged or altered with the help of AI. The belief fueled their suspicions that the government was hiding something. One week later  the military launched an unsuccessful coup  citing the video as part of the motivation.\\n\\nSubsequent forensic analysis never found anything altered or manipulated in the video. That didnâ\\x80\\x99t matter. The mere idea of deepfakes had been enough to accelerate the unraveling of an already precarious situation.\\n\\nIn the lead-up to the 2020 US presidential elections  increasingly convincing deepfake technology has led to fears about how such faked media could influence political opinion. But a new report from Deeptrace Labs  a cybersecurity company focused on detecting this deception  found no known instances in which deepfakes have actually been used in disinformation campaigns. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s had the more powerful effect is the knowledge that they could be used that way.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDeepfakes do pose a risk to politics in terms of fake media appearing to be real  but right now the more tangible threat is how the idea of deepfakes can be invoked to make the real appear fake â\\x80\\x9d says Henry Ajder  one of the authors of the report. â\\x80\\x9cThe hype and rather sensational coverage speculating on deepfakesâ\\x80\\x99 political impact has overshadowed the real cases where deepfakes have had an impact.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDocumentation is no longer evidence\\nHuman rights activists and disinformation experts have sounded the alarm on these separate yet intertwined threats since deepfakes appeared on the scene. In the past two years  US tech companies and policymakers have focused almost exclusively on the first problem Ajder mentions: the ease with which the technology can make fake things look real. But itâ\\x80\\x99s the second that troubles experts more. While the barriers to creating deepfakes may be falling rapidly  calling the veracity of something into question requires no tech at all.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt gives another weapon to the powerful: to say â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s a deepfakeâ\\x80\\x99 about anything that people who are out of power are trying to use to show corruption.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSam Gregory\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrom the very beginning  itâ\\x80\\x99s been my biggest worry in this space â\\x80\\x9d says Aviv Ovadya  a disinformation expert who now runs the nonprofit Thoughtful Technology Project.\\n\\nUndermining trust in the media can have deep repercussions  particularly in fragile political environments. Sam Gregory  the program director of Witness  a nonprofit that helps people document human rights abuses  offers an example. In Brazil  which has suffered a history of police violence  citizens and activists now worry that any video they film of an officer killing a civilian will no longer be sufficient grounds for investigation. This fear that real evidence can plausibly be dismissed as fake  says Gregory  has become a recurring theme in workshops he hosts around the world.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s an evolution of the claim that something is â\\x80\\x98fake news â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cIt gives another weapon to the powerful: to say â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s a deepfakeâ\\x80\\x99 about anything that people who are out of power are trying to use to show corruption  to show human rights abuses.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nProving the real is real and the fake is fake\\nSolving these problems will require understanding both types of threat. â\\x80\\x9cAt a high level  you want to make it as easy as possible to show that a real thing is real and that a fake thing is fake â\\x80\\x9d says Ovadya.\\n\\nIn recent months many research groups  and tech companies like Facebook and Google  have focused on tools for exposing fakes  such as databases for training detection algorithms and watermarks that can be built into digital photo files to reveal if they are tampered with. Several startups have also been working on ways to build trust through consumer applications that verify photos and videos when theyâ\\x80\\x99re taken  to form a basis for comparison if versions of the content are circulated later. Gregory says tech giants should integrate both kinds of checks directly into their platforms to make them widely available.\\n\\nBut tech companies also need to employ human content moderators  and media organizations need to train journalists and fact checkers on both detection and verification as well. On-the-ground reporting can confirm whether or not a video reflects reality and add an important layer of nuance. â\\x80\\x9cTechnical models cannot interpret the content of the faked video across cultural contexts or imagine how it could be further recontextualized â\\x80\\x9d says Britt Paris  an information studies expert who recently published a report on deepfakes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat [disinformation actors] really want is not for you to question more  but for you to question everything.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAviv Ovadya\\n\\nAs an example  Paris points to altered videos of Nancy Pelosi and Jim Acosta that went viral over the past year. Both were so-called â\\x80\\x9ccheapfakesâ\\x80\\x9d rather than deepfakesâ\\x80\\x94their speed had simply been tampered with to mislead viewers. â\\x80\\x9cThere would be no way to catch these fakes with technical methods for catching deepfakes â\\x80\\x9d Paris says. Instead  journalists had to debunk themâ\\x80\\x94which meant people had to trust the journalists.\\n\\nFinally  all the experts agree that the public needs greater media literacy. â\\x80\\x9cThere is a difference between proving that a real thing is real and actually having the general public believe that the real thing is real â\\x80\\x9d Ovadya says. He says people need to be aware that falsifying content and casting doubt on the veracity of content are both tactics that can be used to intentionally sow confusion.\\n\\nGregory cautions against placing too large a burden on news consumers  however. Researchers  platforms  and journalists should do as much of the work as possible to help make clear what is real and what is fake before news reaches the public.\\n\\nThe ultimate goal  Ovadya says  is not to instill overall skepticism but to build â\\x80\\x9csocial  educational  inoculating infrastructureâ\\x80\\x9d for neutralizing the impact of deepfakes. â\\x80\\x9cWhat should we be trying to avoid?â\\x80\\x9d he asks. â\\x80\\x9cIt is valuable to be questioning evidence. But what [disinformation actors] really want is not for you to question more  but for you to question everything.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe adds  â\\x80\\x9cThat is the antithesis of what we\\'re looking for.â\\x80\\x9d\\n '"

      "But it  s still looking for ways to keep users on the site\n",
      "by     Karen Hao Sep 27  2019 Ms\n",
      "Tech; Images: screengrabs from YouTube | Gibi ASMR/ASMR Darling/W magazine/ASMR Glow Recommendation algorithms are some of the most powerful machine-learning systems today because of their ability to shape the information we consume\n",
      "YouTube  s algorithm  especially  has an outsize influence\n",
      "The platform is estimated to be second only to Google in web traffic  and  70%  of what users watch is fed to them through recommendations\n",
      "In recent years  this influence has come under heavy scrutiny\n",
      "Because the algorithm is optimized for getting people to engage with videos  it tends to offer choices that reinforce what someone already likes or believes  which can create an addictive experience that shuts out other views\n",
      "This also often rewards the most extreme and controversial videos  which  studies  have shown can quickly push people into  deep rabbit holes of content  and lead to political  radicalization \n",
      "While YouTube has publicly said that it  s working on addressing these problems  a  new paper  from Google  which owns YouTube  seems to tell a different story\n",
      "It proposes an update to the platform  s algorithm that is meant to recommend even more targeted content to users in the interest of increasing engagement\n",
      "Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No Here  s how YouTube  s recommendation system  currently works \n",
      "To populate the recommended-videos sidebar  it first compiles a shortlist of several hundred videos by finding ones that match the topic and other features of the one you are watching\n",
      "Then it ranks the list according to the user  s preferences  which it learns by feeding all your clicks  likes  and other interactions into a machine-learning algorithm\n",
      "Among the proposed updates  the researchers specifically target a problem they identify as   implicit bias\n",
      "It refers to the way recommendations themselves can affect user behavior  making it hard to decipher whether you clicked on a video because you liked it or because it was highly recommended\n",
      "The effect is that over time  the system can push users further and further away from the videos they actually want to watch\n",
      "To reduce this bias  the researchers suggest a tweak to the algorithm: each time a user clicks on a video  it also factors in the video  s rank in the recommendation sidebar\n",
      "Videos that are near the top of the sidebar are given less weight when fed into the machine-learning algorithm; videos deep down in the ranking  which require a user to scroll  are given more\n",

      "Tech; Images: screengrabs from YouTube | Gibi ASMR/ASMR Darling/W magazine/ASMR Glow Recommendation algorithms are some of the most powerful machine-learning systems today because of their ability to shape the information we consume\n",
      "YouTube  s algorithm  especially  has an outsize influence\n",
      "The platform is estimated to be second only to Google in web traffic  and  70%  of what users watch is fed to them through recommendations\n",
      "In recent years  this influence has come under heavy scrutiny\n",
      "Because the algorithm is optimized for getting people to engage with videos  it tends to offer choices that reinforce what someone already likes or believes  which can create an addictive experience that shuts out other views\n",
      "This also often rewards the most extreme and controversial videos  which  studies  have shown can quickly push people into  deep rabbit holes of content  and lead to political  radicalization \n",
      "While YouTube has publicly said that it  s working on addressing these problems  a  new paper  from Google  which owns YouTube  seems to tell a different story\n",
      "It proposes an update to the platform  s algorithm that is meant to recommend even more targeted content to users in the interest of increasing engagement\n",
      "Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No Here  s how YouTube  s recommendation system  currently works \n",
      "To populate the recommended-videos sidebar  it first compiles a shortlist of several hundred videos by finding ones that match the topic and other features of the one you are watching\n",
      "Then it ranks the list according to the user  s preferences  which it learns by feeding all your clicks  likes  and other interactions into a machine-learning algorithm\n",
      "Among the proposed updates  the researchers specifically target a problem they identify as   implicit bias\n",
      "It refers to the way recommendations themselves can affect user behavior  making it hard to decipher whether you clicked on a video because you liked it or because it was highly recommended\n",
      "The effect is that over time  the system can push users further and further away from the videos they actually want to watch\n",
      "To reduce this bias  the researchers suggest a tweak to the algorithm: each time a user clicks on a video  it also factors in the video  s rank in the recommendation sidebar\n",
      "Videos that are near the top of the sidebar are given less weight when fed into the machine-learning algorithm; videos deep down in the ranking  which require a user to scroll  are given more\n",
      "When the researchers tested the changes live on YouTube  they found significantly more user engagement\n",
      "Though the paper doesn  t say whether the new system will be deployed permanently  Guillaume Chaslot  an ex-YouTube engineer who now runs AlgoTransparency.org  said he was   pretty confident that it would happen relatively quickly:   They said that it increases the watch time by 0.24%\n",

       "'courtesy of Penguin Random House Artificial Intelligence  /  Machine Learning We can  t trust AI systems built on deep learning alone Gary Marcus  a leader in the field  discusses how we could achieve general intelligence  and why that might make machines safer. by     Karen Hao Sep 27  2019 courtesy of Penguin Random House Gary Marcus is not impressed by the hype around deep learning. While the NYU professor believes that the technique has played an important role in advancing AI  he also thinks the field  s current overemphasis on it may well lead to its demise. Marcus  a neuroscientist by training who has spent his career at the forefront of AI research  cites both technical and ethical concerns. From a technical perspective  deep learning may be good at mimicking the perceptual tasks of the human brain  like image or speech recognition. But it falls short on other tasks  like understanding conversations or causal relationships. To create more capable and broadly intelligent machines  often referred to colloquially as artificial general intelligence  deep learning must be combined with other methods. Sign up for     The Algorithm      artificial intelligence  demystified Also stay updated on MIT Technology Review initiatives and events? Yes No When an AI system doesn  t truly understand its tasks or the world around it  that could also lead to dangerous consequences. Even the smallest unexpected changes in a system  s environment could make it go awry. Already there have been innumerable examples of this: hate speech detectors that are easy to fool  job application systems that perpetuate discrimination  and self-driving cars that have crashed  sometimes killing the driver or a pedestrian. The quest for artificial general intelligence is more than an interesting research problem. It has very real-world implications. In their new book  Rebooting AI   Marcus and his colleague Ernest Davis advocate for a new path forward. They believe we are nowhere close to achieving such general intelligence  but they are also confident that we can get there eventually. I spoke with Marcus about the weaknesses of deep learning  the lessons the field can borrow from the human mind  and why he  s optimistic. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Why do we even want general intelligence? Narrow AI has already generated a lot of value for us. Gary Marcus courtesy of Gary Marcus It has  and it will generate even more. But there are lots of problems that narrow AI just doesn  t seem very capable of. Things like conversational natural-language understanding and general assistance in the virtual world  or things like Rosie the robot that might be able to help you tidy your home or cook you dinner. Those are just way outside of the scope of what we can do with narrow AI. It  s also an interesting empirical question about whether narrow AI can get us to safe driverless cars. The reality so far is that narrow AI has a lot of problems with outlier cases  even for driving  which is a fairly constrained problem. More generally  I think we would all like to see AI help us make new discoveries in medicine at scale. It  s not clear that current techniques are going to get us to where we need to be  because biology is complicated. You really need to be able to read the literature. Scientists have causal understandings about how networks and molecules interact; they can develop theories about orbits and planets or whatever. With narrow AI  we can  t get machines to do that level of innovation. With general AI  we might well be able to revolutionize science  technology  medicine. So I think working toward general AI is very much a worthy project. It sounds like you  re using general AI to refer to robust AI? General AI is about having AI be able to think on the fly and resolve new problems on its own. This is as opposed to  let  s say  Go  where the problem hasn  t changed in 2 000 years. General AI also ought to be able to work just as comfortably reasoning about politics as reasoning about medicine. It  s the analogue of what people have; any reasonably bright person can do many  many different things. You take an undergraduate intern and  within a few days  have them work on essentially anything from a legal problem to a medical problem. It  s because they have a general understanding of the world  and they can read  so they  re able to contribute to a very wide range of things. The relation between that and robust intelligence is if you  re not robust  you  re probably not really going to be able to do the general thing. So in order to build something that  s reliable enough to deal with a world that  s constantly changing  you probably need to at least approach general intelligence. But you know  we  re pretty far from that right now. AlphaGo can play very well on a 19x19 board but actually has to be retrained to play on a rectangular board. Or you take your average deep-learning system  and it can recognize an elephant as long as the elephant is well lit and you can see the texture of the elephant. But if you put the elephant in silhouette  it might well not be able to recognize it anymore. As you mention in your book  deep learning can  t really reach general AI because it  s missing deep understanding. In cognitive science we talk about having cognitive models of things. So I  m sitting in a hotel room  and I understand that there  s a closet  there  s a bed  there  s the television that  s mounted in an unusual way. I know that there are all these things here  and I don  t just identify them. I also understand how they relate to one another. I have these ideas about how the outside world works. They  re not perfect. They  re fallible  but they  re pretty good. And I make a lot of inferences around them to guide my everyday actions. The opposite extreme is something like the Atari game system that DeepMind made  where it memorized what it needed to do as it saw pixels in particular places on the screen. If you get enough data  it can look like you  ve got understanding  but it  s actually a very shallow understanding. The proof is if you shift things by three pixels  it plays much more poorly. It breaks with the change. That  s the opposite of deep understanding. You suggest returning to classical AI to solve this challenge. What are the strengths of classic AI that we should be trying to incorporate? I  m just sort of flabbergasted at how little appreciation the deep-learning community in general has for that. There are a few. First  classical AI actually  is  a framework for building cognitive models of the world that you can then make inferences over. The second thing is  classical AI is perfectly comfortable with rules. It  s a strange sociology right now in deep learning where people want to avoid rules. They want to do everything with neural networks  and do nothing with anything that looks like classical programming. But there are problems that are routinely solved this way that nobody pays attention to  like making your route on Google maps. We actually need both approaches. The machine-learning stuff is pretty good at learning from data  but it  s very poor at representing the kind of abstraction that computer programs represent. Classical AI is pretty good at abstraction  but it all has to be hand-coded  and there is too much knowledge in the world to manually input everything. So it seems evident that what we want is some kind of synthesis that blends these approaches. This ties into the chapter where you mention several things that we can learn from the human mind. The first one builds on what we  ve already been talking about  the idea that our minds are made up of many disparate systems that work in different ways. I think there  s another way of making the point  which is: every cognitive system that we have is really doing a different thing. Similarly  the counterparts in AI need to be designed to tackle different problems that have different characteristics. Right now people are trying to use kind of one-size-fits-all technologies to tackle things that are really fundamentally different. Understanding a sentence is fundamentally different from recognizing an object. But people are trying to use deep learning to do both. These are qualitatively different problems from a cognitive perspective  and I  m just sort of flabbergasted at how little appreciation the deep-learning community in general has for that. Why expect that one silver bullet is going to work for all of that? It  s not realistic  and it doesn  t reveal a sophisticated understanding of what the challenge of AI even is. Another thing you bring up is the need for AI systems to understand causal relationships. Do you think that  s going to come from deep learning  classical AI  or something entirely new? It  s again a place where deep learning is not particularly well suited. Deep learning doesn  t give explanations for why things happen but  rather  a probability for what might happen in a given circumstance. Nature builds the first draft  the rough draft. Then learning revises that draft throughout the rest of your life. The kind of stuff that we  re talking about  you look at some scenarios  and you have some understanding about why it happens and what might happen if certain things were changed. I can look at the easel that the hotel television is on and guess that if I cut away one of the legs  the easel will tip over and the television is going to fall down with it. That  s causal reasoning. Classical AI gives us some tools for this. It can represent  for example  what a support relationship is and what  s falling over. I don  t want to oversell it  though. One problem is classic AI mostly depends on very complete information about what  s going on  whereas I just made that inference without actually being able to see the entire easel. So I  m somehow able to make shortcuts  inferring pieces of the easel that I can  t even see. We don  t really have tools that can do that yet. A third thing you bring up is the idea of humans having innate knowledge. How do you see that being incorporated into AI systems? For humans  by the time you  re born  your brain is actually very elaborately structured. It  s not fixed  but nature builds the first draft  the rough draft. Then learning revises that draft throughout the rest of your life. A rough draft of the brain already has certain capabilities. A baby ibex just a few hours old can scramble down the plane of a mountain without making mistakes. Clearly it has some understanding of three-dimensional space  its own body  and the interrelation between the two. Pretty sophisticated stuff. This is part of why I think we need hybrids. It  s hard to see how we could build a robot that functions well in the world without analogous knowledge there from the start  as opposed to starting with a blank slate and learning through enormous  massive experience. For humans  our innate knowledge comes from our genomes that have evolved over time. For AI systems  they have to come a different way. Some of that can come from rules about how we build our algorithms. Some of it can come from rules about how we build the data structures that those algorithms manipulate. And then some of it might come from knowledge that we just directly teach the machines. It  s interesting that you tie everything in your book back to the idea of trust and building trustworthy systems. Why did you particularly choose that frame? Because I think it  s the whole ballgame right now. I think that we  re living in a weird moment in history where we are giving a lot of trust to software that doesn  t deserve that trust. I think that the worries that we have now are not permanent. A hundred years from now  AI will warrant our trust  and maybe sooner. But right now AI is dangerous  and not in the way that Elon Musk is worried about. But in the way of job interview systems that discriminate against women no matter what the programmers do because the techniques that they use are too unsophisticated. I want us to have better AI. I don  t want us to have an AI winter where people realize this stuff doesn  t work and is dangerous  and they don  t do anything about it. In a way  your book actually feels very optimistic  because you  re suggesting that it  s possible to build trustworthy AI. We just need to look in a different direction. Right  the book is very short-term pessimistic and very long-term optimistic. We think that every problem that we described in the book can be solved if the field takes a broader view about what the right answers are. And we think that if that happens  the world will be a better place. '"
